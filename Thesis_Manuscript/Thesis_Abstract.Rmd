# Abstract

The Olympia oyster, *Ostrea lurida* is the focus of many restoration projects in North American Pacific Coast estuaries while the non-indigenous Pacific oyster, *Crassostrea gigas*, makes up the vast majority of oyster aquaculture culture along the same coast.
This study investigates the filtration contributions of restored *O. lurida* habitat and *C. gigas* aquaculture in four California bays using a whole-habitat in situ method.
Two water quality instruments collected upstream-downstream measurements of chlorophyll $\alpha$, temperature, salinity, and turbidity measurements to determine habitat clearance rates (HCR L hr^-1^m^-2^).
In parallel, I collected ambient water samples to measure seston total particulate matter (TPM), and organic content (OC), and gathered existing bivalve density and biomass data when available.
Twenty-eight trials were conducted at three *O. lurida* restoration sites and one *C. gigas* long-line aquaculture site in California from February 2018 to June 2019.
Results indicate that restored *O. lurida* habitat and *C. gigas* aquaculture in different bays have similar HCRs, however HCRs were highly variable at each site and encompass previous bivalve HCR values.
Random forest regression analysis found that temperature (22.5%) was the relatively most important variable to HCR, followed by turbidity (20.3%), TPM (19.2%), OC (17.6%), site (10.9%), and salinity (9.5%).
Whole-habitat measurements that incorporate both the filtration contributions of all bivalve filter-feeders and natural hydrodynamics are important to producing realistic water clearance functions of oyster habitats.
Restored *O. lurida* habitat can also restore substantial water clearance functions to California bays.
