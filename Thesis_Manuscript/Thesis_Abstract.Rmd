# Abstract

The Olympia oyster, *Ostrea lurida* is the focus of many restoration projects in estuaries in the North American Pacific Coast, whearas the non-indigenous Pacific oyster, *Crassostrea gigas*, makes up the vast majority of oyster aquaculture in the region.
My project investigated the filtration contributions of restored *O. lurida* habitat and *C. gigas* aquaculture in four California bays using a whole-habitat, *in situ* approach.
I used two water quality instruments to collect upstream-downstream measurements of chlorophyll $\alpha$, temperature, salinity, and turbidity to estimate habitat clearance rates (HCR, L hr^-1^m^-2^).
In parallel, I collected ambient water samples to estimate seston total particulate matter (TPM), and organic content (OC), and examined existing data on bivalve density and biomass.
Twenty-two experimental trials and four control trials were conducted at three *O. lurida* restoration sites and one *C. gigas* long-line aquaculture site in California from February 2018 to June 2019.
Restored *O. lurida* habitat and *C. gigas* aquaculture had qualitatively similar HCRs, however HCRs were highly variable within and among sites, though they were in the range of published HCR values for bivalves.
Using random forest regression analysis, I found that temperature (22.5%) was relatively most important to HCR, followed by turbidity (20.3%), TPM (19.2%), OC (17.6%), site (10.9%), and salinity (9.5%).
To estimate the filtration functions of oyster habitat, measurements need to include all bivalve filter-feeders and natural hydrodynamics. Considering these factors I found *O. lurida* habitat can help restore substantial water clearance functions in California bays.
