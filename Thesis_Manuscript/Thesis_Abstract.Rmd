# Abstract

The Olympia oyster, *Ostrea lurida* is the focus of many restoration projects in estuaries in the North American Pacific coast, whearas the non-indigenous Pacific oyster, *Crassostrea gigas*, makes up the vast majority of oyster aquaculture in the region.
My project investigated the filtration contributions of three restored *O. lurida* habitats and one long-line *C. gigas* aquaculture opperation in four California bays using a whole-habitat, *in situ* approach.
I collected upstream-downstream measurements of chlorophyll $\alpha$, temperature, salinity, and turbidity to estimate habitat clearance rates (HCR, L hr^-1^m^-2^).
In parallel, I estimated seston total particulate matter (TPM), and organic content (OC), and examined existing data on bivalve density and biomass.
Twenty-two experimental trials and four control mudflat trials were conducted from February 2018 to June 2019.
Mean HCR at *O. lurida* restoration sites were 166 L hr^-1^ m^-2^ (*SD* = 255) at San Rafael, -464 L hr^-1^ m^-2^ (*SD* = 1420) at Shellmaker, and 105 L hr^-1^ m^-2^ (*SD* = 251) at Deanza, while the *C. gigas* aquaculture site at Morro Bay was 10.3 L hr^-1^ m^-2^ (*SD* = 257).
HCRs were highly variable within and among sites, and not significantly different. 
Using random forest regression analysis, I found that temperature (23.1%) was relatively most important to HCR, followed by turbidity (20.6%), TPM (16.8%), OC (16.6%), site (15.1%), and salinity (7.8%).
The contributions of all bivalve filter feeders and natural hydrodynmaics are inherently included the in whole-habitat *in situ* measurements in this study. 
My research indicates that *O. lurida* habitat may restore substantial filtration functions in California bays.
