# Abstract

The Olympia oyster (*Ostrea lurida*) is the focus of many restoration projects in North American Pacific Coast estuaries because it creates complex three-dimensional habitat that is occupied by a host of other bivalve filter-feeders. 

This study investigates the filtration contributions of restored *O. lurida* habitat and Pacific oyster (*Crassostrea gigas*) aquaculture in four California bays using a whole-habitat in situ method.
Two water quality instruments collected upstream-downstream measurements of chlorophyll $\alpha$, temperature, salinity, and turbidity measurements to determine habitat clearance rates (HCR L hr^-1^m^-2^).
In parallel, I collected ambient water samples to measure seston total particulate matter (TPM), and organic content (OC), and gathered existing bivalve density and biomass data when available.
Twenty-eight trials were conducted at three *O. lurida* restoration sites in San Rafael and Newport Bay, California and one *C. gigas* long-line aquaculture site in Morro Bay, California from February 2018 to June 2019.
Results indicate that restored *O. lurida* habitat and *C. gigas* aquaculture in different bays have similar HCRs, however HCRs were highly variable at each site encompassing the range of values recorded in the only other published HCR field study from Florida.
Mention Random Froest WQ relative importantce.
Whole-habitat measurements that incorporate the filtration contributions of all bivalve filter-feeders and natural hydrodynamics are important to producing realistic water clearance functions of oyster habitats and my results and indicated that restored *O. lurida* habitat can also restore substantial water clearance functions to California bays.
