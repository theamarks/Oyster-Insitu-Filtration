The Olympia oyster (*Ostrea lurida*) is subject of many restoration project in North American Pacific Coast estuaries because it creates complex three-dimensional habitat that a host of other bivalve filter-feeders use. 
This study investigates the use of a whole-habitat in situ method to measure the the contributions of restored *O. lurida* habitat and Pacific oyster (*Crassostrea gigas*) aquaculture in four California bays.
Upstream-downstream measurements of chlorophyll $\alpha$, temperature, salinity, and turbidity measurements were collected by two water quality instruments.
