# Introduction

## Oyster Filtration Functions

In estuaries along the North American Pacific coast (NAPC), the Olympia oyster, *Ostrea lurida*, is a foundation species that autogeneously creates complex three-dimensional habitat [@Dayton1972].
The shells of living and dead oysters provide habitat for a variety of invertebrates [@Kimbro2006; @Ramsey2012; @Rodney2006; @Boyer2017], nursery, refuge, and foraging habitat for fishes [@Coen2007; @Peterson2003; @Stunz2010], and foraging habitat for birds [@Galtsoff1929; @Boyer2017].
*O. lurida* and other bivalves that recruit to oyster habitat are suspension feeders that remove particulate matter (seston) from the water column and deposit mucus-bound feces and pseudofeces (i.e. biodeposits) on the sediment surface [@Elsey1935; @Baird1989; @Dame1999; @Kellogg2013].
This feeding behavior contributes to three critical ecosystem functions, nutrient sequestration, trophic energy transfer, and water clarification.
Most of the seston particulate organic matter (POM) is ingested by bivalves for growth and maintenance.
Nutrients incorporated into bivalve shells can be sequestered long-term [@Kellogg2013] when buried in sediments [@Hu2011], and likely serve as a sink for anthropologically produced nutrients [@Martinetto2006; @Carmichael2012].
Bivalve feeding is an important biochemical pathway, linking the water column to the benthos, that transfers energy to higher trophic levels [@Rodney2006; @Kautsky1987] and supplies nutrients to benthic seagrasses [@Peterson1999].
Bivalve biodeposits can have higher organic and nitrogen content than particles settling out of the water column [@Kautsky1987; @Muschenheim1987], providing high quality food for deposit feeders and subsequently feeding omnivores and carnivores including fish [@Rodney2006].
Lastly, seston removal via bivalve filter feeding increases water clarity [@Newell2004b; @Grizzle2008; @Grizzle2018] and, thus, the amount of photosynthetically available radiation reaching benthic primary producers, such as seagrasses [@Newell2004b] and microalgae [@Newell2002].

At a regional scale, the capacity of *O. lurida*'s filtration functions was diminished when *O. lurida* populations were decimated in the late 1800s and early 1900s by destructive fishing practices [@Kirby2004], introduction of non-native species [@Bonnot1935], pollution, and excessive sedimentation [@Gilbert1917; @Lotze2006; @Nelson1909].
Currently, *O. lurida* populations are less than 10% of historical abundance in parts of the Pacific Northwest, and to less than 1% in the rest of its geographic range [@Beck2011; @ZuErmgassen2012].
The extreme reduction of native *O. lurida* abundances and, therefore, the important estuarine habitat *O. lurida* creates, is likely coupled with the loss of water filtration functions. 
Restoring filtration functions is a component of the impetus behind native *O. lurida* restoration and living shoreline projects efforts along the West Coast, in concert with habitat provision and sediment stabilization [@Dinnel2009; @Henderson2015b; @Latta2015; @Wasson2015; @Zacherl2015a].
*O. lurida* restoration often occurs on mudflats that have their own filtration functions driven by epibenthic bivalves.

Dwindling *O. lurida* harvests led to the cultivation of the Japanese oyster, *Crassostrea gigas*, [@Beattie1982] in the Salish Sea in the early 1920s [@Quayle1988], and in California in 1928 [@Conte1982].
*C. gigas* now accounts for the overwhelming majority of commercial oyster harvest on the NAPC [@Beattie1982; @Pauley1988], and has established feral populations outside of aquaculture operations in the Salish Sea [@Quayle1988], Willipa Bay, Washington [@Kincaid1968], and southern California [@Crooks2015a; @Polson2009; @Tronske2018].
*C. gigas* is a large, fast growing oyster with higher filtration rates than *O. lurida* per unit dry tissue weight (DTW) [@Bougrier1995; @ZuErmgassen2013c; @Gray2018; @Gray2019], and can exert top-down control of seston at aquaculture densities [@Wheat2013].
Ecosystem filtration functions (e.g. nutrient sequestration, sediment enrichment, and water clarification) and habitat quality in NAPC estuaries may differ between native *O. lurida* habitat and cultivated *C. gigas* aquaculture [@Ruesink2006; reviewed by @Ruesink2005].

***Not sure about this add***
For instance, *C. gigas* has a higher partial capture efficiency presumably because of its smaller gill ostea than *O. lurida* [@Elsey1935; @Gray2018; @Gray2016].
In addition, depending on the *C. gigas* aquaculture operation, aquaculture is maintained as a monoculture, whereas *O. lurida* habitat recruits other bivalve filter feeders, possibly providing aggregate filtration functions.

## Single-species Research

Estimating the filtration capacity of *O. lurida* habitat and *C. gigas* aquaculture currently relies on a handful of single-species studies [@ZuErmgassen2016; @ZuErmgassen2013c; @Gray2018; @Gray2019a] and a single field aquaculture study [@Wheat2013].
@Gray2018 estimated the clearance rates of *O. lurida* and *C. gigas* under a range of laboratory and seasonal *in situ* conditions using the biodeposition method [@Hawkins1996].
These models provide important insights into the feeding responses of individual *O. lurida* and *C. gigas* to specific conditions (temperature, salinity, turbidity, chlorophyll $\alpha$, total particulate matter (TPM), and organic content (OC)), but may not be appropriate for estimating whole-habitat clearance rates in the field [@Cranford2011; @Grizzle2018] because it does not incorporate local habitat or environmental conditions.
For example, non-oyster filter-feeders living in *O. lurida* habitat, contribute to the overall filtration capacity of the habitat [@Grizzle2018; @Grizzle2008; @Byers2014; @Gedan2014].
These non-oyster filter-feeders that occupy oyster habitat have species-specific feeding behavior [@MÃ¸hlenberg1979; @Riisgard1988; @Riisgard2001; @Cranford2011; @Gray2016; @Gedan2014]. 
The regional composition of this filter-feeding guild is likely to change along the NAPC, consequently creating unique filtration signatures for different *O. lurida* habitat.
In addition, clearance rates calculated based on biomass are not particularly useful in assessing whether restored *O. lurida* habitat is also restoring filtration functions; restoration practitioners are hesitant to sacrifice bivalves to measure biomass directly.

## Whole-Habitat Measurements

The complex biological and physical characteristics of oyster habitat highlight the need for *in situ*, whole-habitat filtration measurements [@Grizzle2008; @Grizzle2018; @Gedan2014; @Byers2014] specific to the habitat.
Whole-habitat *in situ* filtration measurements have several distinct advantages over single-species measurements.
First, *in situ* measurements include the contributions of the entire filter-feeding guild.
Next, individual bivalve feeding variation is aggregated with a higher precision in *in situ* measurements than filtration rates derived from individual bivalve feeding trials [@Jones2011a; @Iglesias1998; @Cranford2011].
Filtration studies often exclude individuals that are not filtering (closed valves), and artificially inflate filtration models and overestimate filtration when extrapolated to the population level [@Cranford2011; @Harsh1999]; this may partly explain why many field studies find lower filtration rates than laboratory studies [@Newell2005; @Grizzle2008; @Cranford2011]. 
Lastly, bivalve feeding responses to natural water flow dynamics along with spatial and seasonal changes in seston composition are inherently included in whole-habitat *in situ* measurements. 

Water flow dynamics in the field are highly variable [@Wilson-Ormond1997] due to the interaction of tidal prisms and the physical characteristics of bays and estuaries [@Dame2012].
Whereas the direct effects of water velocity on bivalve filter-feeding is unclear [@Grizzle1992; @Cranford1998; also see review in @Judge1992], water velocity and depth affect water column mixing and sediment re-suspension [@Widdows1998], and thus, food availability for benthic filter-feeders.
The quantity, particle size, and organic content (OC) of seston available can affect filter-feeders' feeding behavior [@Gray2018; @Gray2019; @Cranford1999; @Newell2005; @Velasco2005; @Moody2020a; @Moody2020].
Natural seston is composed of phytoplankton [@Navarro1995], zooplankton [@Lehane2006; @Trottet2008], macroalgae detritus [@Page1997; @Kwak1997; @Gilbane2006], bacteria [@Newell1989], and inorganic sediments [@Wilson-Ormond1997; @Gray2018].
Although @Gray2018 used ambient sea water from Yaquina Bay, Oregon in their *in situ* experiments across seasons, seston also changes spatially and temporally due to tides, wind, bathometry, and proximity to benthic organisms [@Navarro1995; @Muschenheim1987; @Ashley1988; @Moody2020a], limiting their findings to bays with similar seston profiles.  
@Cranford2011 conducted a meta-analysis of 133 bivalve clearance rate studies and found highly variable short-term fluctuations in clearance rates, as well as intermittent feeding cessation, when bivalves were fed with natural seston.
This illustrates bivalves' highly variable feeding responses to natural conditions, further making the case that whole-habitat *in situ* measurements are needed for ecologically and environmentally realistic filtration estimates of *O. lurida* habitat and *C. gigas* aquaculture. 

## Research Questions

Here, I assessed the contributions of restored *O. lurida* habitat and *C. gigas* aquaculture to estuary filtration functions in California, as a function of natural water quality conditions and filter feeder communities, which are expected to vary among locations.
My research questions were:
1) Do oyster habitat habitat clearance rates (HCR) differ from adjacent mudflat habitat HCR?
2) How do the HCRs of restored *O. lurida* habitat compare to *C. gigas* aquaculture?
3) What biotic and abiotic factors are important in estimating HCR?
4) Is there a predictable allometric relationship between *O. lurida* shell length and dry tissue weight, allowing for accurate estimates of DTW without sacrificing restored oysters?
