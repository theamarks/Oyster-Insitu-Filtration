# Introduction

The Olympia oyster (*Ostrea lurida*) is a former foundation species in estuaries along the Pacific North American Coast by autogeneously providing complex three-dimensional habitat [@Dayton1972] used by a variety of invertebrates, juvenile fishes and feeding habitat for birds and larger fishes [@Kimbro2006; @Ramsey2012; @Coen2007; @Peterson2003].
*O. lurida* and many of the invertebrates that recruit to the oyster habitat (i.e. mussels, tunicates, scallops, and sponges) are suspension feeders that remove organic and inorganic particles from the water column (seston) and deposit unused material in the benthos [@Baird1989; @Dame1999]. This feeding activity increases water clarity [@Newell2004b; @Grizzle2008; @Grizzle2018] and enriches benthic sediments (need citations) useful to benthic primary producers like seagrasses [@Peterson1999].
Overfishing in concert with destructive fishing practices [@Kirby2004], introduction of non-native species [@Bonnot1935], pollution, and excessive sedimentation [@Gilbert1917; @Lotze2006; @Nelson1909] decimated *O. lurida* populations to less than 10% of historical abundances in parts of the Pacific Northwest, and to less than 1% in the rest of its geographic distribution [@Beck2011; @ZuErmgassen2012].
The extreme reduction of native *O. lurida* abundances is coupled with the loss of estuarine habitat structure, and water filtration funcitons.
Restoring these ecosystem functions is part of the impetus behind native *O. lurida* restoration efforts along the west coast [@Dinnel2009; @Henderson2015b; @Latta2015; @Wasson2015; @Zacherl2015a]. 

### Single-species Reseach

Estimating the filtration capacity of natural and restored *O. lurida* habitat and *C. gigas* aquaculture currently relies on single-species models produced by a handfull of studies [@ZuErmgassen2016; @ZuErmgassen2013c; @Gray2018; @Gray2019a]. 
@Gray2018 determined the clearance rates (Lhr^-1^g^-1^ Dry Tissue Weight) of *O. lurida* and *C. gigas* under a range of  laboratory and seasonal in situ conditions using the biodeposition method [@Hawkins1996].
During the in situ trials individual oyster were placed in a flow through chamber filled with ambient seawater from Yaquina Bay, Oregon at a rate of 150-200 ml min^-1^, and individuals not filtering (closed valve) were excluded from the analysis [see @Cranford2011].
The models from this study provide important insights into *O. lurida* and *C. gigas* individual's feeding responses to specific conditions (temperature, salinity, turbidity, chlorophyll $\alpha$, Total Particulate Matter (TPM), and Organic Content (OC)) but may not be appropriate for estimating whole-habitat filtration in the field [@Cranford2011; @Grizzle2018; Velasco2005; Newell2005] because it does not incorporate habitat or environmental conditions.
For example, non-oyster filter-feeders living in the oyster habitat contribute to the overall filtration capacity of the habitat [@Grizzle2018; @Grizzle2008; @Byers2014; @Gedan2014] and have species-specific feeding behavior [@Møhlenberg1979; @Riisgard1988; @Riisgard2001; @Cranford2011; Gray2016; @Gedan2014].
The composition of this filter-feeding guild is likely to change across *O. lurida*'s distrubution, thus creating unique filtraiton signatures for different *O. lurida* habitat.

The complex biolgical and physical characteristics of *O. lurida* habitat point to the need for in situ, whole-habitat filtration measurements [@Grizzle2008; @Grizzle2018; @Gedan2014; @Byers2014] specific to the habitat.
Whole-habitat in situ filtration measurements have several distinct advantages over single-species models;
1) As previously mentioned, measurements include the contributions of the entire filter-feeding guild;
2) Measurements have an automatic averaging/agregate of individual bivalve feeding variation with a higher precision than filtration rates derived from individuals (Cranfor 1998, Inglesias et al 1998).
Futhermore, studies that exculde individuals that are not filtering (closed valves) artificially inflate filtration models, overestimate filtration when expanded to the population level [@Cranford2011; @Luckenbach1999] and may partly explain why many field studies find lower filtration rates than laboratory studies [@Gray2018 cited Newell 2005; @Grizzle2008; @Cranford2011]; 
3) The affects of natural water flow dynamics along with spatial and seasonal changes to seston compositio on bivalve feeding behavior are inherently included in whole-habitat in situ measurements. 

Water flow dynamics in the field are highly variable [@Wilson-Ormond1997] due to the interaction of tidal cycles and the physical characteristics of bays and estuaries (citations needed. @Judge1992).
While the direct effects of water velocity on bivalve filter-feeding is unclear (@Grizzle1992; more), water depth and velocity affect water column mixing, thus food availability for benthic filter-feeders (Monismith et al 1990 in Harsh & Luckenbach 1999 BAD) (Holligan et al. 1984 cited in Judge et al. 1993).
The quantity, particle size, and organic content (OC) of seston avilable to filter-feeders can effect filter-feeders' feeding behavior [@Gray2018; @Gray2019; @Gray2016; Velasco2005; @Cranford1999; Moody2020?].
Natural seston is composed of phytoplankton [@Navarro1995], zooplankton [@Lehane2006; @Trottet2008], macroalgae detritus [@Page1997; @Kwak1997; @Gilbane2006], bacteria [@Newell1989], and inorganic sediments [@Wilson-Ormond1997; @Gray2018].
Although @Gray2018 used ambient sea water from Yaquina Bay in their in situ experiment across seasons, seston also changes spatially and temporally from tides, wind, bathometry, and proximety to benthic organisms [@Navarro1995; @Muschenheim1987; @Ashley1988; @Moody2020a), limiting their findings to bays with similar seston profiles.  
@Cranford2011 conducted a metaanalysis of 133 bivalve clearance rate studies, they found highly variable short-term flucuations in clearance rates, as well as intermitant feeding cessation, when bivalves were fed with natural seston.
This illustrates bivalve's highly variable feeding responses to natural conditions and that ecologically and environmentally realistic  filtration estimates need whole-habitat in situ measurements.

### Research Questions

The motivation of this study was to determine the first ecologiacally and environmentally realistic clearance rates of restored *O. lurida* habitat and *C. gigas* aquaculture in California.
Our research objectives were: 
1) quantify the changes in water quality (temperature & salinity) and seston (chl $\alpha$, turbidity) as water traveled over oyster habitat; 
2) characterize the inorganic and organic composition of seston; 
3) investigate if methods derived from @Grizzle2006-@Grizzle2008 are appropriate for measuring oyster habitats in California; and
4) characterize the bivalve filter-feeder community of restored *O. lurida* shell beds in Upper Newport Bay, California.

### Incorporate these tidbits?
Whole -habitat measurements inately measure the habitat-level filtraiton reaction to hydrodynmaics and food availability.

Chl $\alpha$ - proxy for photosynthetic organic matterial - Check @Secor2006 for ideas

Higher organic content means a higher proportion of digestable food, which increases clearance rates (@Gray2017a). [read Bayne et al. 1989; Barillé et al. 1997; Hawkins et al. 1998a; Bayne 2002; Ward and Shumway 2004)]. 

Residence time, temperature, turbidity, food availability, salinity, emersion time, and water flow speed are all parameters known to affect bivalve filter feeding rates, and will be unique to each California estuary. 
Thus, previous filtration estimates are not directly applicable to existing restoration and aquaculture operations in California.

@Wheat2013 *C. gigas* aquaculture in Willapa Bay, WA showed that seston and phytoplankton were refulated top-down by commercially grown C. gigas, thus C. gigas may play a substantial role in overall water filtration in CA estuaries, particularly when associated wit haquaculture operations in Morro Bay. 

### Save for discussion? 

along with the presence of predators [@Byers2014] 

Moreover, various filter-feeding taxa preferentially select for specific particle sizes [@Gedan2014; @Gray2016] depending on feeding physiology [@Elsey1935], leading to possible resource partitioning or competition that effects the net filtration [@Byers2014].
This suggests that filtration rates among *O. lurida* habitats, may have unique filtration rates locally or regionally depending on the composition of filter-feeders, and laboratory methods a likely insufficient at estimating habitat-level filtration funcitons. 

Gray & Langdon (2017) point out that O. lurida selects larger particles from the water column compared to C. gigas, likely because of anatomical differences in gill ostea, which may differentiate the quality of filtration by each species. 
C. gigas is also faster growing, larger, and has a greater filtration rate than O. lurida (zu Ermgassen, Gray, et al. 2013, Gray & Langdon 2017)

Different species have different ideal water velocities for feeding [@Cranford2011].
Slow velocity, although possibly ideal for individual filtration [@Grizzle1992], can lead to food depletion for downstream animals (Monismith et al 1990 in Harsh & Luckenbach1999).
On the other hand, both higherflows and shallow estuaries can redistribute particles throughout the watercolumn replenishing food for bivalve filterfeeders (Officer 1982 & Fredett 1989 in Harsh & Lauckenbach1999) (Holligan et al. 1984 cited in @Judge1993)
In addition, deeper water might limit benthic bivalves access to food (citations in Ruesink et al. 2005), while the orientation of oysters relative to the waterflow may effect feeding behavior[@Grizzle1992; @Harsh1999].


### Whole-habitat outline
* Whole-habitat measurements also include realistic environmental conditions known to affect bivalve filtration rates
  + Texture of habitat leads to varied hydrodynamics and mixing (Harsh & Luckenback 1999) that can effect environmental that mediate filtration.
  + Slow flow can lead to food depletion to downstream animals (Monismith et al 1990 in Harsh & Luckenbach1999).
  + Higher flows can redistribute particles throughout the water column replenishing food for bivalve filter feeders ( Officer 1982 & Fredett 1989 in Harsh & Lauckenbach1999)
  + Water dynamics in shallow estuaries often mixes water column "eliminating stratification of chlorophyll (Holligan et al. 1984 cited in @Judge1993).
  + Deeper waters might limit the access that benthic bivalves have to food (citations in @Ruesink2005).
  + Orientation of oyster relative to flow effect feeding behavior [@Grizzle1992; @Harsh1999].
  + Laboratory studies often don't include oysters not feeding, closed valves, resulting in artificially high filtration rates [@Gray2018; @Harsh1999], and may partly explain why many field studies find lower FR than laboratory studies [@Gray2018 cited Newell 2005; @Grizzle2008; @Cranford2011].
  + In situ studies may not be able to produce the sophisticated models based on manipulated variables, but can record the range of Filtration capacity of a specific restoration or aquaculture operation within its complex environment.
