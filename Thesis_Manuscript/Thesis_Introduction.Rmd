### History of Oysters on the West Coast

The Olympia oyster (*Ostrea lurida*) has enhabited California estuaries since the late Miocene and early Pliocene [@Arnold1909, @Howard1935] and is currently the only native oyster to the North American Pacific coast from British Columbia, Canada (Polson and Zacherl 2009) to Baja California, Mexico (Raith et al. 2016).
*O. lurida* is a foundation species for estuarine ecosystems and had a varied relationship with humans over time.


Contents of coastal shellmounds indicate *O. lurida* was abundant and a substancial component of indegenous peoples' diets as early as 3,500 years ago [@Nelson1909,  @Gifford1916].
Historic shell midens built by indegenous peoples along the coast indicate that *O. lurida* was harvested as an important food source [@Merlin1977, @Elsasser1966, @Barner1981, Kidd 1967?].
Non-indegenous settlers commercialized *O. lurida* harvests in the early 1800s in San Francisco, CA (Conte & Dupuy 1981 in Kirby 2005).
The start of the gold rush in 1849 led to overfishing *O. lurida* in San Francsico (Beattie, McMillin & Wiegardt 1982 in Kirby 2004) and shipments of *O. lurida* from estuaries subsequently up the coast [@Kirby2004].
Hydraulic mining in Sierra Nevada mountains washed an estimated 1,146 million cubic yards - 876 million cubic meters into the San Francisco Bay, smothering intertidal habitats [@Gilbert1917]
Destructive harvest [@Kirby2004], nutrient and sediment pollution (Hopkins et al. 1931, Lotze et al. 2006), invasive species, and disease (Ruesink et al. 2005) led to the collapse of historical *O. lurida* populations. 
Import of non-native oyster species.
Currently, *O. lurida* abundances are less than 1% of historical estimates in California (Beck et al. 2011). 
Non-native oyster species were introduced to the west coast starting in 1904 (reviewed in (Baker 1995)) [read Galtsoff 1929, Bonnot 1935, Elsasser and Heizer 1966, Kidd 1967, Baker 1995] to subsidize dwindling native *O. lurida* harvests. 
[The most sucessful introduced oyster was the Japanese oyster, the most cultivated oyster worldwide, accounts for 90% of oyster aquaculture] The Japanese oyster (Crassostrea gigas) has established feral populations outside of aquaculture operations in Southern California (Crooks, Crooks and Crooks 2015; Zacherl, personal observations) [Am I talking about the whole coast or just Cali?]. 

(Not sure if I need this sentence) indegenous peoples living along the coast from California to Washington [@Barner1981, @Elsasser1966, @Nelson1909, @Gifford1916].

### Oyster Provide Ecosystem Services

The extreme reduction in native *O. lurida* abundances is coupled with the loss of important hard substrate habitat and its associated ecosystem services. 
Oyster larvae settle and grow on hard substrate, often other oyster shells (Prytherch 1931). 
This behavior forms three dimensional structures known as beds or reefs, depending on the extent of physical relief (greater than 0.5 m qualifying as a reef and less than 0.5 m qualifying as a bed Beck et al. 2009). 
These biogenic structures make oysters foundation species (sensu Dayton 1972) as their shells, living or dead, physically create habitat for a multitude of invertebrates, juvenile fishes and feeding habitat for birds and larger fishes (Coen et al. 2007). 
Oyster beds and reefs can also provide protection against shoreline erosion by diminishing wave energy in low energy environments (Meyer et al. 1997, Piazza et al. 2005) like estuaries and bays. 

### Gap in Filtration Knowlege / What We Know

In addition to creating habitat and shoreline protection, oysters are also suspension feeders that remove phytoplankton, bacteria, algae, and suspended sediments from the water column. 
Unwanted material is deposited into the benthos in the form of feces and pseudofeces (Dame 1999), increasing water clarity (Newell and Koch 2004; Grizzle, Greene and Coen 2008) useful to benthic primary producers, like seagrasses (Peterson and Heck 1999). 
Restoring this suite of ecosystem functions is a part of the impetus behind native *O. lurida* restoration efforts in Washington, Oregon, and California (Dinnel et al. 2009, Henderson et al. 2015, Latta & Boyer 2015, Wasson et al. 2015, Zacherl et al. 2015). 
However, because of the small size of *O. lurida*, larger gill ostrea (Gray & Langdon) and thus lower filtration rate relative to larger oysters in the Crassostrea genus (zu Ermgassen et al. 2013a), the filtration services of *O. lurida* on the West Coast is in question.

### Why We Need Insity Filtration Study
	
First, *O. lurida* beds are complex habitat used by other filter feeding organisms (i.e. mussels, tunicates, scallops, and sponges) that may substantially contribute to net filtration, and differ among bays. 
Second, environmental conditions like temperature (Gray and Langdon 2017), seston organic content (Kreeger and Newell 2001; Gray and Langdon 2017), salinity (Gray and Langdon 2017), and water velocity (Grizzle, Langan and Howell 1992; Luckenbach and Harsh 1999) are all known to affect bivalve filtration rates, and are unique to each water body. 
Third, research in Washington state showed that seston and phytoplankton were regulated top-down by commercially grown C. gigas (Wheat and Ruesink, 2013), which is a more robust filter feeder than *O. lurida* (Bougrier et al. 1995; zu Ermgassen et al. 2013; Gray and Langdon 2017) thus cultivated C. gigas ~~may~~ play a substantial role in overall water filtration in Pacific bays. 
This and many other studies use chlorophyll $\alpha$ as a metric for filtration (Luckenbach and Harsh 1999; Wasson et al. 2015; Grizzle, Greene, and Coen 2008; Grizzle et al. 2006) because chlorophyll $\alpha$ is a plant pigment whose concentration is a proxy for phytoplankton and algae fragments consumed by filter feeders [Is this the right place for this Chl info?]. 
In summary, filtration models of oyster habitat lack in situ comparisons that incorporate complex environmental conditions and other bivalve contributions to overall filtration function of restored *O. lurida* habitat and C. gigas aquaculture. 
My research uses in situ methods based on Grizzle et al. (2006 & 2008) and Milbrandt et al. (2015) to test previous filtration models, using restored and aquaculture oyster habitat.

Oyster habitat provides myriad ecosystem services, such as water filtration, to bays and estuaries worldwide. Laboratory and limited in-situ studies have provided initial estimates of the filtration services provided by the U.S. West Coast’s only native oyster,  Ostrea lurida, but refined field-based estimates that consider multiple biological and physical factors are sorely needed. We propose to quantify field-based filtration rates of restored oyster habitats and aquaculture arrays (such as floating upweller systems called FLUPSYs) in California, providing managers with refined estimates of the filtration services provided by oysters and their associated habitat. Our filtration rates, expressed in L/hr/m2, will allow us to calculate filtration services of oyster habitat based on water quality characteristics specific to a particular bay or estuary (e.g., oyster and associated community density, habitat area, tidal elevation, water flow speed, water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll concentration, and turbidity). Beneficiaries of this research include the Port of San Diego, Orange County Coastkeeper, California State Coastal Conservancy, and future oyster restoration practitioners. 

The Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) is native to the western North American coast, ranging from British Columbia, Canada (Polson & Zacherl 2009) to Baja California, Mexico (Raith et al. 2016). This species was an important food source for Native Americans and European settlers. Overexploitation of Olympia oysters and anthropogenic pollution led to the introduction of several non-native oyster species for aquaculture purposes to subsidize the dwindling native oyster harvests starting in 1904 (reviewed in Baker 1995). Introduced species included the Eastern oyster (C. virginica), and the Pacific oyster (C. gigas). Currently, native oyster abundances are less than 1% of historical estimates in both southern and northern California (Beck et al. 2011), while C. gigas has established feral populations outside of aquaculture operations in Newport Bay and San Diego Bay (Crooks et al. 2015, Zacherl, personal observations). The extreme reduction in native oyster abundance is coupled with a staggering loss of key habitat and the ecosystem services it can provide. As one example, oysters are suspension feeders that remove phytoplankton, bacteria, algae, and suspended sediments from the water column, increasing water clarity (Newell & Koch 2004, Grizzle et al. 2008)

Two studies based in Yaquina Bay, Oregon provide a strong foundation for estimating O. lurida filtration rates (zu Ermgassen, Gray, et al. 2013, Gray & Langdon 2017), but several important factors useful for estimating filtration rates remain underexplored.  Previous filtration studies were conducted in the laboratory or were single-species, in-situ studies (zu Ermgassen, Gray, et al. 2013, Gray & Langdon 2017), while O. lurida beds are complex habitat used by other filter feeding organisms (i.e. C. gigas, mussels, tunicates, scallops, and sponges) that may substantially contribute to overall filtration. Further, O. lurida habitat contains differing filter feeder communities across estuaries; San Francisco Bay does not have a feral C. gigas population, while Newport and San Diego Bays contain abundant C. gigas. Next, environmental conditions of estuaries vary greatly in space and time and previous studies have only focused on limited field conditions in Yaquina Bay, Oregon with isolated O. lurida (Gray & Langdon 2017). Residence time, temperature, turbidity, food availability, salinity, emersion time, and water flow speed are all parameters known to affect bivalve filter feeding rates, and will be unique to each California estuary. Thus, previous filtration estimates are not directly applicable to existing restoration and aquaculture operations in California.

Native O. lurida and non-native C. gigas may overlap in ecological services like filtration. However, physiological differences between the oyster species may change the degree of their respective filtration services. Gray & Langdon (2017) point out that O. lurida selects larger particles from the water column compared to C. gigas, likely because of anatomical differences in gill ostea, which may differentiate the quality of filtration by each species. C. gigas is also faster growing, larger, and has a greater filtration rate than O. lurida (zu Ermgassen, Gray, et al. 2013, Gray & Langdon 2017), but feral populations of C. gigas in Newport and San Diego Bays experience significantly less immersion time than O. lurida due to an observed zonation pattern between the species. C. gigas settles and grows at higher tidal elevations (+1 to +3.5 ft MLLW), and is thus immersed in the water column for a shorter duration than O. lurida, which settles and grows at lower tidal elevations (-1 ft MLLW to +1 ft MLLW) (Zacherl, ms submitted); each species is also associated with an entirely different filter-feeding community at their respective tidal elevations.  Although feral C. gigas is immersed for shorter durations than O. lurida in Newport Bay and San Diego Bay, research in Willapa Bay, Washington showed that seston and phytoplankton were regulated top-down by commercially grown C. gigas (Wheat & Ruesink 2013), thus C. gigas may play a substantial role in overall water filtration in California estuaries, particularly when associated with aquaculture operations in Morro Bay, Agua Hedionda, and San Diego Bay.

Water residence time, and the presence of aquaculture operations are other factors that will affect overall oyster filtration capacity. California bays typically have low average residence times, so zu Ermgassen, Gray, et al. (2013) speculate that oysters may only affect seston and phytoplankton concentrations in the back portions of such bays and estuaries where residence times increases, and thus where oysters and other filter feeders may impact water quality. Evidence from Wheat & Ruesink (2013) and Gray & Langdon (2017) suggests that C. gigas aquaculture operations located in the inner reaches of California’s bays and estuaries may play a role in returning filtration services lost from decimated O. lurida populations. Recently, the Port of San Diego initiated an Aquaculture and Blue technology incubator program, and their next steps include water quality testing to assess the capacity for basket-raised oysters and FLUPSY operations to affect bay water quality. Our proposed research will help inform their near-future decisions about, “where oyster growing might be feasible in the future.” 

The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) published a Manager's guide (zu Ermgassen et al. 2016) that includes several models to estimate the quantity of ecosystem services provided by restored oyster habitat. Filtration of *O. lurida* habitat is calculated using data from a single laboratory study (zu Ermgassen et al., 2013), while the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) filtration model uses a combination of laboratory and in situ data. In situ filtration rates of *O. lurida* habitat are important to estimate filtration functions under complex environmental conditions often difficult to simulate in a laboratory setting. Gray and Langdon (2017) measured in situ filtration of isolated *O. lurida* in Yaquina Bay, Oregon, providing a foundation for estimating in situ *O. lurida* filtration rates. However, three factors important to filtration remain underexplored.
