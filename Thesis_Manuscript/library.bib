abstract = {Biodeposit production of Mjrtilus eduLis was studied in situ over an annual cycle in the northern Baltic proper. Faeces and pseudofaeces were collected in traps covered by a layer of mussels and placed on the bottom at 5 m depth. The summed deposition due to sedimentation and biodeposition was compared with deposition in mussel-free control traps on the bottom and suspended in the water column. Both quantity and quality of deposited matter increased through biodeposition. Relative contribution of matenal from M. edulis was hlghest in summer, whereas both sedimentation and biodeposition peaked in autumn. Annual biodeposition by M. edulis was 1.76 g dry weight, 0.33 g ash- free dry weight, 0.13 g carbon, l.? X IO-{\~{}} g nitrogen and 2.6 X 104 g phosphorus per g mussel (dry weight including shells). During the productive season from April to September the organic content of biodeposits was higher than that of naturally sedimenting material (30.4 vs 24.8{\%}), despite having passed the mussels' alimentary tracts. Nitrogen content of biodeposited material was also higher than that in control traps (1.68 vs 1.20 {\%} of dry weight), while phosphorus content was the same (0.19 {\%}) in both. The higher contents of carbon and nitrogen in biodeposits may be explained by the fact that the mussels to a large extent remove and initiate the sedimentation of small particles of high organic content whch would otherwise stay in suspension. We argue that M. edulis occupies an important role as a connecting link between pelagic and benthic ecosystems by increasing total annual deposition of C, N and P by 10 {\%} and by circulating and regenerating 12 and 22 {\%}, respectively, of the annual N and P demands for pelaqc pnmary production in the area.

abstract = {The influence of bed density (from 0 to 1000ind.m-2) and flow speed (2, 5, and 15cms-1, i.e. "low", "medium" and "high", respectively) on clearance rates (CR) of an infaunal suspension-feeding bivalve (Austrovenus stutchburyi) and boundary layer dynamics were investigated in annular flumes. Near-bed flow speeds decreased and bed shear stresses increased with bivalve density due to the bed roughness generated by the shallow burrowers. At low densities ({\textless}500ind.m-2) there was no detectable effect of feeding currents on bed shear stress, but at high densities (1000ind.m-2) and at the low flow speed bed shear stress was almost 80{\%} higher when Austrovenus were feeding (0.0016Nm-2), compared to when they were not feeding (0.0009Nm-2). These results suggest that bed roughness generated by Austrovenus and their feeding currents are capable of influencing food supply to the bed. Individual CR were significantly (p{\textless}0.01) greater at the high flow speed (0.88Lh-1ind.-1), compared to the medium and low flow speeds (0.34 to 0.54Lh-1ind.-1). With increasing bed density, individual CR was significantly (p{\textless}0.001) reduced; at low densities CR ranged from 0.6 to 1.4Lh-1ind.-1, but at high densities they were 0.1 to 0.8Lh-1ind.-1. Bed CR (Lh-1m-2) did not scale proportionally with density, initially increasing up to 500ind.m-2 but remaining relatively constant thereafter. This was in part due to the negative effect of density on individual CR but also because the proportion of bivalves feeding decreased with increasing density. Our results demonstrate that recording the number of bivalves feeding is necessary to interpret the effect of density on bed CR. Moreover, if the effects of both bivalve density and flow speed are not considered, then scaling up individual CR obtained using animals at low densities will over estimate population filtration capacity. As high (but equivalent to in situ) densities reduced both the number of animals feeding and individual CR other factors may offset this negative interaction, such as protection from wave disturbance or enhanced resuspension of benthic microalgae. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Highly productive tropical seagrasses often live adjacent to or among coral reefs and utilize large amounts of inorganic carbon. In this study, the effect of seagrass productivity on seawater carbonate chemistry and coral calcification was modelled on the basis of an analysis of published data. Published data (11 studies, 64 records) reveal that seagrass meadows in the Indo-Pacific have an 83{\%} chance of being net autotrophic, resulting in an average net sink of 155 gC m −2 yr −1 . The capacities for seagrass productivity were analysed using an empirical model to examine the effect on seawater carbonate chemistry. Our analyses indicate that increases in pH of up to 0.38 units, and $\Omega$ arag increases of 2.9 are possible in the presence of seagrass meadows (compared to their absence) with the precise values of these increases dependent on water residence time (tidal flushing) and water depth. In shallow water reef environments, Scleractinian coral calcification downstream of seagrass has the potential to be ≈18{\%} greater than in an environment without seagrass. If this potential benefit to reef calcifiers is supported by further study it offers a potential tool in marine park management at a local scale. The applicability of this will depend upon local physical conditions as well as the spatial configuration of habitats, and the factors that influence their productivity. This novel study suggests that, in addition to their importance to fisheries, sediment stabilization and primary production, seagrass meadows may enhance coral reef resilience to future ocean acidification.},

abstract = {Biotic invaders are species that establish a new range in which they proliferate, spread, and persist to the detriment of the environment. They are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about largely through human transport and commerce. In a world without borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these im- migrations. The fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. Few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. In turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. There are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) In agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous "tax" on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) The global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable. Identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment con- stitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. Detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) Efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) Predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) Eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. Successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) Control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystem- wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) Prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. Revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a "guilty until proven innocent" approach would be a productive first step. Failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. Given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change. Left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in profound but still unpredictable ways},

abstract = {Structured population models, particularly size- or age-structured, have a long history of informing conservation and natural resource management. While size is often easier to measure than age and is the focus of many management strategies, agestructure can have important effects on population dynamics that are not captured in size-only models. However, relatively few studies have included the simultaneous effects of both age- and size-structure. To better understand how population structure, particularly that of age and size, impacts restoration and management decisions, we developed and compared a size-structured integral projection model (IPM) and an age- and size-structured IPM, using a population of Crassostrea gigas oysters in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. We analyzed sensitivity of model results across values of local retention that give populations decreasing in size to populations increasing in size. We found that age- and sizestructured models yielded the best fit to the demographic data and provided more reliable results about long-term demography. Elasticity analysis showed that population growth rate was most sensitive to changes in the survival of both large ({\textgreater}175 mm shell length) and small ({\textless}75 mm shell length) oysters, indicating that a maximum size limit, in addition to a minimum size limit, could be an effective strategy for maintaining a sustainable population. In contrast, the purely size-structured model did not detect the importance of large individuals. Finally, patterns in stable age and stable size distributions differed between populations decreasing in size due to limited local retention and populations increasing in size due to high local retention. These patterns can be used to determine population status and restoration success. The methodology described here provides general insight into the necessity of including both age- and size-structure into modeling frameworks when using population models to inform restoration and management decisions.},

abstract = {Structure-building, autogenic ecosystem engineers are recognized worldwide as potential tools for coastal protection, which depends on long-term sustainability and persistence of their structures. For reef-building oysters, reefs are maintained through accumulation of shell material, which depends on recruitment and growth and which provides substrate for new generations. Knowledge of the fundamental niche of oysters in relation to biotic and abiotic conditions helps define the area where ecosystem engineers grow and survive well and where their structures are likely to persist and be effective for coastal protection. Response curves of different life-history stages (larvae, juveniles and adults) of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas were investigated along a tidal emersion gradient in a manipulative field study. Density of juvenile oysters was maximal around 36{\%} tidal emersion. Shell growth of juveniles and adults, condition index (CI) of adults and mortality of adults were negatively related to tidal emersion, whereas mortality of juveniles was positively related to tidal emersion. Tidal emersion had a strong effect on oyster survival and growth, with the most favourable being around 20 to 40{\%} tidal emersion, as indicated by recruit density and the CI of adults. These findings suggest that the area of 20 to 40{\%} tidal emersion is optimal for reef development, which is in line with other investigations of C. gigas and the eastern oyster C. virginica across different systems, supporting a broader geographical application of these findings.},

@article{North2010,
abstract = {Restoration of ecologically important marine species and habitats is restricted by funding constraints and hindered by lack of information about trade-offs among restoration goals and the effectiveness of alternative restoration strategies. Because ecosystems provide diverse human and ecological benefits, achieving one restoration benefit may take place at the expense of other benefits. This poses challenges when attempting to allocate limited resources to optimally achieve multiple benefits, and when defining measures of restoration success. We present a restoration decision-support tool that links ecosystem prediction and human use in a flexible "optimization" framework that clarifies important restoration trade-offs, makes location-specific recommendations, predicts benefits, and quantifies the associated costs (in the form of lost opportunities). The tool is illustrated by examining restoration options related to the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, which supported an historically important fishery in Chesapeake Bay and provides a range of ecosystem services such as removing seston, enhancing water clarity, and creating benthic habitat. We use an optimization approach to identify the locations where oyster restoration efforts are most likely to maximize one or more benefits such as reduction in seston, increase in light penetration, spawning stock enhancement, and harvest, subject to funding constraints and other limitations. This proof-of-concept Oyster Restoration Optimization model (ORO) incorporates predictions from three-dimensional water quality (nutrients-phytoplankton zooplankton-detritus [NPZD] with oyster filtration) and larval transport models; calculates size- and salinity-dependent growth, mortality, and fecundity of oysters; and includes economic costs of restoration efforts. Model results indicate that restoration of oysters in different regions of the Chesapeake Bay would maximize different suites of benefits due to interactions between the physical characteristics of a system and nonlinear biological processes. For example, restoration locations that maximize harvest are not the same as those that would maximize spawning stock enhancement. Although preliminary, the ORO model demonstrates that our understanding of circulation patterns, single-species population dynamics and their interactions with the ecosystem can be integrated into one quantitative framework that optimizes spending allocations and provides explicit advice along with testable predictions. The ORO model has strengths and constraints as a tool to support restoration efforts and ecosystem approaches to fisheries management. Key},

abstract = {Marine species characterized as structure building, autogenic ecosystem engineers are recognized worldwide as potential tools for coastal adaptation efforts in the face of sea level rise. Successful employment of ecosystem engineers in coastal protection largely depends on long-term persistence of their structure, which is in turn dependent on the population dynamics of the individual species. Oysters, such as the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), are recognized as ecosystem engineers with potential for use in coastal protection. Persistence of oyster reefs is strongly determined by recruitment and shell production (growth), processes facilitated by gregarious settlement on extant shell substrate. Although the Pacific oyster has been introduced world-wide, and has formed dense reefs in the receiving coastal waters, the population biology of live oysters and the quantitative mechanisms maintaining these reefs has rarely been studied, hence the aim of the present work. This study had two objectives: (1) to describe the demographics of extant C.gigas reefs, and (2) to estimate vertical reef accretion rates and carbonate production in these oyster reefs. Three long-living oyster reefs ({\textgreater}30 years old), which have not been exploited since their first occurrence, were examined in the Oosterschelde estuary in the Netherlands. A positive reef accretion rate (7.0-16.9 mm year-1 shell material) was observed, consistent with self-maintenance and persistent structure. We provide a framework to predict reef accretion and population persistence under varying recruitment, growth and mortality scenarios.},

abstract = {The integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (i.e., IMTA) is a practice combining organisms with different trophic levels with the final purpose of transforming the continuous waste of food by targeting species into nutrient input for other non-target species. This practice very often involves filter feeders, such as bivalves, by the use of which bioenergetics budgets are strongly influenced by the quality and quantity of different foods. However, to date, scant information is available, to really understand the rebounds of food availability on the growth performances of these harvested biomasses in the natural environment. By choosing the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis as a model, this study aims to (1) characterize the functional response of the species to define all parameters related to food intake strategies and (2) to investigate how responses change as a function of varying food sources. Laboratory procedures have been designed to evaluate the clearance rates (CR) and assimilation efficiencies (AE) of M. galloprovincialis with varying food concentrations, while different diets (i.e., seagrass, phytoplankton, and pellets) have been provided to investigate how differently they reach saturation. Results show that in the presence of phytoplankton and seagrass as food sources, the feeding strategies of M. galloprovincialis follow a II-type Holling's curve, while it shows a I-type Holling's curve when pellet food is provided. Investigating the behavioural components of functional responses may improve our ability to predict where to place shellfish cultures, as it may be useful in the context of IMTA management and in addressing siting studies. Statement of relevance Our paper focuses on a question central to understanding and predicting the likely impacts of one among the most important human economic activity like the aquaculture in coastal habitats. The main question deals with the possibility to combine experimental procedures with the new mechanistic functional trait based bioenergetic models in order to effectively predict life history traits of cultivated species.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Seagrasses and bivalves co-occur worldwide, and each plays a role in the structure, function, and services of coastal ecosystems. While seagrasses are declining, bivalve aquaculture is expanding, and impacts from culture practices, as opposed to the cultured organisms themselves, need to be distinguished. In 2 experiments, we tested the effects of live Crassostrea gigas, an introduced oyster, on Zostera marina, a native seagrass, in Willapa Bay, Washington. Expt 1 involved adult oyster addition across a large range in density (0 to 70{\%} cover), and also considered the effects of the physical components of an oyster: its shell, and fertilizer mimicking biodeposition. Expt 2 simulated a crop cycle with addition of newly-settled oysters at relevant commercial density (≤20{\%}), which then grew over 3 yr. In Expt 1, seagrass shoot density and size declined (at least 50{\%} and at most 40{\%}, respectively) with oyster addition. Steep declines indicating density-dependent space competition occurred at different thresholds after 1 (1.3{\%} oyster cover), 2 (12.4{\%}), and 3 yr (21.9{\%}). Live oysters changed sediment characteristics, increasing organic content, silt:sand ratios, and levels of porewater ammonium, but these changes did not affect eelgrass. Nutrient addition did not affect density or growth, although it augmented porewater ammonium. In Expt 2, no significant reductions in density, size, or growth of seagrass occurred. Our results suggest that the effects of introduced oysters on seagrass occur through space competition and can exceed the footprint of the oysters, generating strong impacts above a threshold of {\~{}}20{\%} cover.},

abstract = {The predatory neogastropod Ocinebrellus inornatus was first reported from Europe in W France in 1995 and has since been detected at other sites in NW and N France and The Netherlands. It is native to the North Pacific where it preys on the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Here we report on the occurrence of the species in beds of European oysters (Ostrea edulis) in the Limfjord, NW Jutland, Denmark. The morphology-based identification has been confirmed by genetic analysis. The species was probably introduced with oysters imported from France in the 1970s and 1980s. The invasion is still relatively localized but as the species has established a reproductive population, it may eventually spread to other parts of the fjord and in time pose a problem to the oyster fishery. The species' invasion history is reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Humans intensely use southern California rocky shores for recreational activities such as fishing, exploration, walking, enjoyment of the out-of-doors, and educational field trips. People also collect intertidal organisms for consumption, fish bait, home aquariums, and other purposes. In Orange County, visitors concentrate their activities on a few rocky headlands and reefs. Many of these shores have been designated as California Marine Life Refuges (CMLRs) or State Ecological Reserves (SERs), where the removal of most intertidal organisms, except for scientific purposes, has been unlawful for 30 years. In a yearlong study of eight Orange County shores, unlawful collecting of organisms was often observed. In addition, lifeguards have frequently observed unlawful collecting on these and other shores. The CMLR or SER designation did not deter collecting. Mussels, trochid snails, limpets, urchins, and octopuses were the most commonly collected organisms, primarily for food or fish bait. Several of the gastropod species targeted by human collectors had low population densities and population structures dominated by smaller and less fecund individuals, characteristics that often occur in populations exploited by humans. Most collected invertebrates were broadcast spawners that require high densities of fertile individuals to optimize reproduction. The cascading effects of collecting on community structure and the reproductive success of exploited populations are unknown. Except for state park rangers at one site, no state enforcement personnel were seen during 768 hours of low-tide observations throughout the year. Without effective enforcement, adequate signage, and educational programs to increase public awareness, CMLRs and SERs are not protecting rocky intertidal populations on heavily visited southern California shores. Improved management practices are needed if CMLRs and SERs are to protect rocky intertidal populations and to serve as bench-mark sites where changes in populations due to regional climatic events or chronic human disturbances can be measured and evaluated in the absence of exploitation.},

abstract = {Research on the effects of bivalve filtration emphasizing oysters has mainly involved extrapolations from laboratory based measurements on individual oysters to potential whole-ecosystem impacts, with only a few studies on reef-scale processes and less using direct measurements. This study characterized spatial effects of whole-reef (oysters, Crassostrea virginica, and other filter feeders on the reef) filtration in the water immediately above and adjacent to a small (∼300 m2) intertidal reef in Tarpon Bay, Sanibel, Florida. Changes in water column parameters were measured in 2010 (chlorophyll a only) and 2013 (chlorophyll a and turbidity) by slowly paddling a kayak back-and-forth across the reef while logging position and water data. Although oysters were the dominant filter feeder, mussels, slipper shells, sponges, and a filter-feeding crab also occurred on the reef. Ambient water flow speed and direction were concurrently determined in 2013 by an acoustic-doppler current profiler. Measurements were made on two days (1–2 June) in 2010, and two days (November 15 and December 9) in 2013. ArcGIS software was used to plot the data and construct two-dimensional maps showing changes in chlorophyll a and turbidity, which clearly indicated the spatial extent of decreases in both as water flowed across the reef. Seston decrease (interpreted as depletion) levels were spatially variable, averaging 23–25{\%} but as high as 68{\%} in some areas directly over the reef. The extent of detectable depletion usually extended 10–20 m beyond the edge of the reef, potentially increasing light levels and thereby providing enhanced growth conditions for adjacent seagrasses and algae, suggesting that restoration success of macrophyte habitats could be enhanced by close spatial coupling with oyster reef restoration.},

abstract = {Dramatic declines in populations of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica are a symptom of degradation in many US Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico estuaries. We sampled 94 oyster reefs (88 constructed, 6 natural) within 11 no-harvest sanctuaries in estuaries of central and northern North Carolina, USA, to evaluate the success of oyster sanctuaries as a conservation tool. The sanctuaries have been in existence from 3 to 30 yr; 10 sanctuaries protect constructed ('restored') oyster reefs and 1 sanctuary protects natural reefs. Measurements of vertical relief, live oyster density, recruitment, abundance of market-sized oysters, and biomass as well as disease prevalence and severity indicated that 7 of the 11 sanctuaries met criteria for minimal success by having vertical relief {\textgreater}20 cm in height, living oysters ({\textgreater}10 oysters m(-2)), and evidence of recent recruitment in 1. of 2 yr of the survey. Most reefs within the 7 sanctuaries far surpassed these relatively low benchmarks. For reefs that failed, burial by sedimentation appeared to be the primary cause in 2 sanctuaries, poor water quality (low dissolved oxygen) in 1, and poor oyster recruitment in another. All intertidal reefs were successful and had significantly higher densities of all size categories of live oysters (spat, adult, marketable size) than subtidal oyster reefs. Disease prevalence and severity were low in sanctuary reefs despite high oyster densities and increased longevity of oysters on these reefs. Pronouncements that restoration of the native eastern oyster is a failure prove incorrect when a decade-long history of oyster reef sanctuaries is evaluated. The proposed introduction of a non-native oyster into the US Atlantic coast estuaries cannot be justified by claiming failure of native oyster restoration in light of promising successes within sanctuaries.},

abstract = {Bivalve molluscs, in common with consumers in general, use behavioral and physiological mechanisms to balance metabolic requirements with available nutrients. This study considered how the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, meets the demands of growth and maintenance, measured in terms of carbon and nitrogen, in a variable food environment. Stoichiometry theory helped to evaluate: a) whether feeding behaviour modifies the intake of C and N given seasonal variability in food quality: b) how rates of metabolism and excretion, and C and N growth efficiencies, respond to mismatch between nutrient intake and the oysters' needs. Two field experiments in the Port Stephens estuary, near Sydney, Australia, measured feeding behaviour, metabolic and growth rates relative to seasonal changes in food supply. In a laboratory experiment, relationships between physiological rates and growth were measured to test a model of growth as a function of absorption of C and N. Potential metabolic targets for compensation were the C/N ratios of body tissues, maintenance and/or of soft tissue added as growth. C/N of whole soft issues varied little during the year (mean 5.4). In July (a time of low food availability of poor quality) growth was negligible and the C/N (maintenance) target was 6.7. In March (abundant food of high quality) growth was rapid with a high N-demand; the C/N of growth was 3.9. In November (medium food quality) there was an enhanced C-demand for glycogen storage; the C/N of growth was 7.9. Feeding behaviour changed the balance between C and N intake across months, primarily due to changes in the selection efficiency for nitrogen, which was highest at low filtration rates on particles of high C/N ratio. Nitrogen intake was favoured over C in July. In November, C-intake increased relative to N. In March, when abundant food nitrogen coincided with a high demand for growth, feeding behaviour was neutral with respect to C/N ratios. In all cases C/N of absorbed matter was greater than the C/N of growth. Growth efficiencies for carbon declined with increased C/N of ingested matter due to higher metabolic increments (SDA) when feeding on lower food quality; the metabolic costs of growth did not vary. In contrast, growth efficiencies for nitrogen did not alter with C/N for ingested matter, due in part to increased nitrogen losses, relative to tissue nitrogen content, when feeding on low C/N food. Nitrogen was therefore conserved metabolically relative to C. Both feeding and metabolic processes contributed to compensation for the mismatch between seasonally variable food quality and the demands of growth. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Simultaneous measurements of near-bed flow and turbulence were collected on opposite banks of an intertidal channel in the North Inlet/Winyah Bay National Estuary Research Reserve. One bank supported an extensive cover of oysters and the other a mixture of sand and mud. The measurements allow comparisons of flow and turbulence characteristics in a similar flow regime but widely varying roughness conditions. Near-bed velocities are higher over the sandbank and occur during the maximum flood portion of the tidal cycle. In contrast, turbulence parameters are higher over the oyster reef, resulting from the presence of the larger roughness elements. Turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stress components increase as a function of flow speed, consistent with equilibrium boundary layer shear flows. For some bursts, the energy spectrum exhibits a -5/3 slope, indicating a defined inertial subrange. Dissipation over the oyster bank is on the order of 10 cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} during maximum flood, when the near-bed current speeds are greatest. Drag coefficient and hydraulic roughness are likewise greater over the oyster bank, with average values of CD = 0.025 and z0 = 0.78 cm compared with CD = 0.004 and z0 = 0.02 cm for the sandbank. The analysis reveals a simple roughness formula for oysters in which the physical bottom roughness is equal to 5 times the average height of the oysters.},

Long appreciated only as a commercial source of oysters, oyster reefs are now acknowledged for the other services they provide, such as enhancing water quality and stabilizing shorelines. We develop a framework to assess the value of these services. We conservatively estimate that the economic value of oyster reef services, excluding oyster harvesting, is between {\$}5500 and {\$}99,000 per hectare per year and that reefs recover their median restoration costs in 2–14 years. In contrast, when oyster reefs are subjected to destructive oyster harvesting, they do not recover the costs of restoration. Shoreline stabilization is the most valuable potential service, although this value varies greatly by reef location. Quantifying the economic values of ecosystem services provides guidance about when oyster reef restoration is a good use of funds.},

abstract = {The bivalve family Ostreidae has a worldwide distribution and includes species of high economic importance. Phylogenetics and systematic of oysters based on morphology have proved difficult because of their high phenotypic plasticity. In this study we explore the phylogenetic information of the DNA sequence and secondary structure of the nuclear, fast-evolving, ITS2 rRNA and the mitochondrial 16S rRNA genes from the Ostreidae and we implemented a multi-locus framework based on four loci for oyster phylogenetics and systematics. Sequence-structure rRNA models aid sequence alignment and improved accuracy and nodal support of phylogenetic trees. In agreement with previous molecular studies, our phylogenetic results indicate that none of the currently recognized subfamilies, Crassostreinae, Ostreinae, and Lophinae, is monophyletic. Single gene trees based on Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BA) methods and on sequence-structure ML were congruent with multilocus trees based on a concatenated (ML and BA) and coalescent based (BA) approaches and consistently supported three main clades: (i) Crassostrea, (ii) Saccostrea, and (iii) an Ostreinae-Lophinae lineage. Therefore, the subfamily Crassotreinae (including Crassostrea), Saccostreinae subfam. nov. (including Saccostrea and tentatively Striostrea) and Ostreinae (including Ostreinae and Lophinae taxa) are recognized. Based on phylogenetic and biogeographical evidence the Asian species of Crassostrea from the Pacific Ocean are assigned to Magallana gen. nov., whereas an integrative taxonomic revision is required for the genera Ostrea and Dendostrea. This study pointed out the suitability of the ITS2 marker for DNA barcoding of oyster and the relevance of using sequence-structure rRNA models and features of the ITS2 folding in molecular phylogenetics and taxonomy. The multilocus approach allowed inferring a robust phylogeny of Ostreidae providing a broad molecular perspective on their systematics.},

abstract = {Sporadic blunders, affecting only one or a few test materials in a run of analysis, will seldom be detected by routine internal quality control (IQC). This is an important problem because blunders may not be particularly rare. IQC works by the analysis in each run of one or more control materials that are closely similar in composition to the routine test materials. The control materials are treated in exactly the same way as the test materials and act as a surrogate for them. Any noteworthy problem with quality will be manifest in the IQC results as a lapse in statistical control. However, at its best, IQC will detect only problems that systematically affect the whole run. The problem Sporadically-occurring large errors in analytical results may be more common than generally thought. It is impossible to get statistics because blunders go undetected—if they are detected they are replaced with valid results. However, in a recent study of proficiency test results from year 2006, encompassing 50 different matrices/analyte combinations and a large population of laboratories in the food sector, the proportion of outliers found was 4.7 {\%} (117 out of 2507 results) * . An example is shown in Figure 1. Some laboratories will consistently do better than others and therefore produce a smaller proportion, but all participants knew that they were under test and were presumably keen to get a good z-score. Moreover, most of the laboratories (65{\%}) claimed to be using an accredited method. Even though the statistic is not a direct indicator of the average proportion of sporadic blunders in a particular laboratory, 4.7{\%} is an alarming level. Sporadic blunders probably comprise the most pervasive and most serious type of problem encountered in analytical results. They contribute to the false impression that analytical results are too often unfit for purpose by virtue of overlarge uncertainty. In reality, most analytical systems are already fit for purpose in},

abstract = {Habitat loss and disturbance are ranked globally as the greatest threats to biodiversity. Development and coastal population growth are the leading causes for habitat losses. Recently, the restoration of marine habitats has increased, especially with the goal of increasing non-consumptive ecosystem services derived from mangrove and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) along with biogenic oyster reefs. Habitats reside in landscapes dominated by multiple species. Rather than focusing on a single habitat such as oysters or mangroves or SAV, we took an approach restoring multiple adjacent habitats to accelerate restoration in a Florida embayment that had been significantly degraded prior to the restoration of natural tidally generated flows. After a multiple habitat die-off, a project was initiated in 2006 to reintroduce tidal flushing. The re-introduction of tidal flushing, however, did not result in immediate recovery of mangrove shorelines or oyster-dominated reefs. There was a lack of mangrove propagule production and significant substrate limitation in areas with appropriate salinity, sediment and tidal flows. From 2009-2012, red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) propagules were collected (over 500,000) and planted for a total area of 3.24ha. From 2009-2010, five intertidal reefs were constructed by adding bagged and fossil shell (54MT) for Crassostrea virginica larvae to recruit onto totaling over 779m2. Monitoring of planted mangrove versus unplanted shorelines demonstrated that prop root and drop root densities were higher where propagules were planted (28m-2) versus unplanted (2.3m-2). Oyster densities and mean sizes (multiple year classes) at new and natural reefs were measured after 8, 12, and 24, and 36 months. An initial settlement pulse was observed in the first 8 months followed by an increase in the density of greater than 1-year old oysters. Xanthid crab densities (Eurypanopeus depressus and Panopeus spp.) in restored reefs and natural reefs were similar, while Petrolisthes armatus densities were lower in restored reefs. Whole reef seston filtration rates over restored reefs were -26 to 157Lm-2h-1 when measured at 4, 15, 28, and 40 months. A multiple habitat approach may be useful in accelerating the natural ecological succession, especially if the project site has reached a degraded, alternate ecological state. These results suggest a multiple habitat approach can be useful in providing non-provisioning ecosystem services to a Florida embayment.},

abstract = {The dietary importance of marsh vascular plants (primarily Salicornia virginica), algae and upland particulate inputs to macro-invertebrate consumers was studied in Carpinteria Salt Marsh, southern California, using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. This marsh is predominantly a marine or hypersaline system and succulents are the most common vascular plant species. Of invertebrates collected from the vegetated marsh, tidal flats and channels, only detritivores from the vegetated marsh (Traskorchestia traskiana, Melampus olivaceus) had isotope values ($\delta$13C=-20‰) that suggested some use of Salicornia-derived carbon. T. traskiana cultured in the laboratory on decomposing S. virginica or blue-green micro-algal mat had distinctive isotopic signatures, reflecting the capability of this consumer to assimilate carbon and nitrogen derived from these sources. The $\delta$13C values (generally - 16‰ to - 15‰) of species from tidal flats and channels (e.g. Cerithidea californica, Protothaca staminea, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Neotrypaea californiensis) were most similar to values for benthic algae and phytoplankton. Specimens of M. galloprovincialis along a gradient of presumed increase in marine influence had similar isotope values, suggesting little contribution to diet from upland runoff. The present results differ most noticeably from published values in the 13C enrichment of suspension-feeders, suggesting the use of resuspended 13C-enriched benthic microalgae in tidal channels by these consumers, and in the 13C depletion and 15N enrichment of plants and consumers along a portion of the marsh boundary receiving inputs of nutrient-enriched perched groundwater. In general, the isotopic composition of macro-invertebrates indicated the incorporation of algal production rather than of S. virginica or upland sources into the marsh food web.},

abstract = {The continuous decline in Earth's biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity - especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) - defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material - is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.},

Historical abundances of large consumer species were fantastically large in comparison with recent observations.

Retrospective data not only help to clarify underlying causes and rates of ecological change, but they also demonstrate achievable goals for restoration and management of coastal ecosystems that could not even be contemplated based on the limited perspective of recent observations alone.},

These surveys were expanded to include exploratory work in the South Coast. to map varnish clam dispersal and distribution of native Olympia oysters.Manila clams, Venerupis philippinarum, were found at low densities in Johnstone and Queen Charlotte Straits and Sunderland Channel. One live clam and some dead shells indicated that the species was present in Seymour and Belize Inlets, but at very low population levels. Manila clams were common on most beaches on the west coast of Vancouver Island, with lower densities recorded in Tofino Inlet and north of Brooks Peninsula.Varnish clams were confirmed from Salmon Bay in Johnstone Strait, and were found in Barkley, Clayoquot and Kyuquot Sounds and Ououkinsh and Nasparti Inlets on the west coast of Vancouver Island. None were found north of Brooks Peninsula.Significant populations of Olympia oysters were recorded from Klaskino and Amai Inlets and Port Eliza. Results of the 2002 surveys, as well as previously documented surveys, indicate that extensive populations of Olympia oysters remain relatively rare in B.C.Most beaches with suitable substrate supported populations of native clam species, including littleneck clams, Protothaca staminea, butter clams, Saxidomus gigantea, cockles, Clinocardium nuttallii, and various Macoma species.

abstract = {Understanding the extent of local adaptation is critical for conservation and restoration planning in an era of environmental change. Adaptive differentiation among populations may mediate a species' response to environmental stress, yet these evolutionary processes are seldom studied in marine systems. We used native Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) as a model organism for studying local adaptation with applications to marine restoration. We tested whether populations of oysters in California estuaries are locally adapted to their home sites and to stressful low salinity events, which are predicted to increase in frequency with climate change. We spawned oysters from three sites in San Francisco Bay and raised their offspring under common laboratory conditions. These oysters were then reciprocally transplanted among the three field sites. At two of the three sites, oysters of local origin tended to survive better than those from other populations, suggesting that local adaptation may occur even within a single estuary. In a subsequent experiment, we raised oysters from two sites in San Francisco Bay and one site in Tomales Bay through two generations under common conditions and then subjected these oysters to a low salinity challenge in the laboratory. Oysters with the highest survival originated from the site with the lowest field salinity, suggesting that natural selection may favor stress tolerant phenotypes in certain regions. As interest grows in restoring heavily impacted native species, our results indicate that considering local adaptation may be essential to deciding how and where to conserve and restore species faced with changing conditions.},

abstract = {A major cause of the steep declines of American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fisheries is the loss of oyster habitat through the use of dredges that have mined the reef substrata during a century of intense harvest. Experiments comparing the efficiency and habitat impacts of three alternative gears for harvesting oysters revealed differences among gear types that might be used to help improve the sustainability of commercial oyster fisheries. Hand harvesting by divers produced 25-32{\%} more oysters per unit of time of fishing than traditional dredging and tonging, although the dive operation required two fishermen, rather than one. Per capita returns for dive operations may nonetheless be competitive with returns for other gears even in the short term if one person culling on deck can serve two or three divers. Dredging reduced the height of reef habitat by 34{\%}, significantly more than the 23{\%} reduction caused by tonging, both of which were greater than the 6{\%} reduction induced by diver hand-harvesting. Thus, conservation of the essential habitat and sustainability of the subtidal oyster fishery can be enhanced by switching to diver hand-harvesting. Management schemes must intervene to drive the change in harvest methods because fishermen will face relatively high costs in making the switch and will not necessarily realize the long-term ecological benefits.},

abstract = {Coastal protection remains a global priority. Protection and maintenance of shoreline integrity is often a goal of many coastal protection programs. Typically, shorelines are protected by armoring them with hard, non-native, and nonsustainable materials such as limestone. This study investigated the potential shoreline protection role of cre- ated, three-dimensional Eastern oyster (Crassostrea vir- ginica) shell reefs fringing eroding marsh shorelines in Louisiana. Experimental reefs (25 3 1.0 3 0.7 m; inter- tidal) were created in June 2002 at both high and low wave energy shorelines. Six 25-m study sites (three cultched and three control noncultched) were established at each shore- line in June 2002, for a total of 12 sites. Shoreline retreat was reduced in cultched low-energy shorelines as compared to the control low-energy shorelines (analysis of variance; p {\textless} 0.001) but was not significantly different between cultched and noncultched sites in high-energy en- vironments. Spat set increased from 0.5 ± 0.1 spat/shell in July 2002 to a peak of 9.5 ± 0.4 spat/shell in October 2002. On average, oyster spat grew at a rate of 0.05 mm/day through the duration of the study. Recruitment and growth rates of oyster spat suggested potential reef sus- tainability over time. Small fringing reefs may be a useful tool in protecting shorelines in low-energy environments. However, their usefulness may be limited in high-energy environments.},

abstract = {Benthic deposition of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)-rich oyster biodeposits may increase denitrification, or anaerobic respiration of nitrate (NO3 (-)) to di-nitrogen gas (N-2). However, environmental drivers of C and N dynamics in oyster biodeposits and reef-adjacent sediments require clarification. In July 2012, we collected intact sediment cores adjacent to and 15-20 m away from two oyster reefs (Crassostrea virginica) in Great Bay, New Hampshire, USA: one reference site and one site with cultural eutrophication. We also measured seston, chlorophyll a, and in situ oyster feeding and biodeposition. Cores were incubated in continuous-flow chambers where inflow water received N-15-ammonium (NH4 (+)), (NO3)-N-15 (-), or no isotopes (control). We quantified fluxes of dissolved nutrients and gasses (oxygen, N-28(2), N-29(2), N-30(2), and argon) after 24 h. Finally, we measured size-fractionated sediment organic matter. At the eutrophic site, abundant phytoplankton in the 5-28 A mu m size range was correlated with enhanced oyster feeding rates and biodeposit quality (lower C:N). This site had greater denitrification rates in reef-adjacent cores relative to distal cores. Low production of N-29,30(2) in (NH4)-N-15 (+) amended cores suggested water column or biodeposit NH4 (+) were unlikely to be converted to N-2. At both sites, reef-adjacent cores had more shell and higher N-29,30(2) production with (NO3)-N-15 (-) addition relative to distal cores, suggesting direct denitrification enhancement near reefs. Oysters likely increased sediment N-2 production via high quality biodeposits (eutrophic site), and NO3 (-) diffusion via structural complexity of reef-adjacent sediment (both sites). Overall, results suggest oyster-mediated ecosystems services may be expected to vary with environmental conditions.},

abstract = {1. The quantity of seston was measured and the elemental carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (C, N, P) and biochemical composition (carbohydrate, protein, lipid) of the {\textless} 53 mu m size fraction in three temperate lakes during one year was analysed. The lakes differed in nutrient concentration and were characterized as oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic. Linear regression analyses defined associations between seston composition and either lake trophic status, depth or season. 2. The concentration of particulate organic seston was greatest during spring and autumn;and lowest during the clear water period in early summer. Seasonal patterns in seston elemental and biochemical percentage composition (quality) were observed to be independent of differences in seston quantity. 3. Concentrations of seston C, N and P were high in most cases in the spring and autumn and low in summer. Concentrations of P were particularly high during late summer and early autumn in the metalimnion, perhaps because of recovery of P from anaerobic sediments and hypolimnetic waters. Because seston C and N did not increase as markedly as P, C:P and N:P ratios both declined in the autumn. Primary production was thought to be co-limited by N and P in all three of these lakes; however, the data suggested that N might be more important as a major limiting nutrient in the eutrophic lake as the metalimnion increased in depth in late summer and autumn. 4. Concentrations of protein, carbohydrate, polar lipid and triglyceride generally increased with lake type as expected (greatest in the eutrophic lake), but showed no relationship with water depth. As the year progressed, no significant changes were measured in protein and carbohydrate concentrations; however, the concentration of polar lipid decreased and triglyceride increased significantly with time of year. 5. The biochemical composition of seston varied during the year and among lakes; for example, in Lake Waynewood the proportion of protein composing the seston (percentage protein by weight) varied from {\textless} 10{\%} to {\textgreater} 40{\%}. No statistically significant patterns in the percentage protein or carbohydrate were found. However, the proportion of seston comprised of triglyceride decreased with lake type and increased during the year; whereas the proportion of seston as polar lipid increased with lake type and decreased during the year. Triglyceride comprised most of the lipid. Both protein:lipid and protein:carbohydrate ratios tended to be greatest in summer and lowest in the spring and autumn. 6. Relationships between samples and biochemical composition analysed by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (Canoco) indicated similar patterns in seasonal changes in seston biochemistry for the three lakes, with samples separated primarily by vectors for lake type (oligotrophic to eutrophic) and the percentage polar lipid (proportion of total lipid) and secondarily by vectors for date and water depth (epilimnion or metalimnion). 7. These seasonal biochemical changes in the seston food base were compared with biochemical changes known to occur in algae grown under N-or P-limited conditions in the laboratory, and the resultant quality of this algal food for suspension-feeding consumers (zooplankton). It was concluded that zooplankton were likely to be physiologically challenged by these distinct seasonal shifts in the quality of lake seston.},

Variations in carbohydrate, lipid and protein in the seston were primarily associated with the periods of high and low standing stocks of phytoplankton observed in this environment. The seasonal trends were very similar for each biochemical component. The nutritional quality of the seston was expressed by a food index, calculated as the ratio of food material to total seston.

Since many have suffered severe population declines, restoration of foundation species has been undertaken worldwide. The Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) is a foundation species, and the restoration of depleted populations is a priority for maintaining ecosystem function of estuaries along the west coast of North America. Here, we synthesize all native oyster restoration projects conducted from California, USA, to British Columbia, Canada, and analyze project goals, methods, and outcomes. Currently, restoration projects are spread unevenly across the species' range, driven by locally varying goals and implemented with contrasting approaches. We highlight the value of regional strategic planning and decision support tools to evaluate project design and methods for restoration, including the selection of substrates and the targeted use of aquaculture. We recommend future investment in larger projects, which our analysis found were more cost-effective, but which have been relatively rare for this species. We also recommend that funders support monitoring over broader temporal and spatial scales than in the past to better characterize long-term effects of restoration on oyster populations and the services they provide beyond the project footprint. We found that most projects successfully supported native oysters and engaged local communities, and recommend similar efforts to continue to enhance understanding of Olympia oysters, which remain unfamiliar to many coastal residents. We believe that the results of this synthesis are broadly applicable to marine foundation species generally, and can inform restoration and conservation efforts worldwide.},

Although further discussion and research leading to a more complete understanding is required, oysters and other molluscs (e.g. mussels) in estuarine ecosystems provide services far beyond the mere top-down control of phytoplankton blooms, such as (1) seston filtration, (2) benthic-pelagic coupling, (3) creation of refugia from predation, (4) creation of feeding habitat for juveniles and adults of mobile species, and for sessile stages of species that attach to molluscan shells, and (5) provision of nesting habitat.},

In this paper, we address these two issues for quantile regression models. In particular, we develop an informative stochastic search variable selection (ISSVS) for quantile regression models that introduces an informative prior distribution. We adopt prior structures which incorporate historical data into the current data by quantifying them with a suitable prior distribution on the model parameters. This allows ISSVS to search more efficiently in the model space and choose the more likely models. In addition, a Gibbs sampler is derived to facilitate the computation of the posterior probabilities. A major advantage of ISSVS is that it avoids instability in the posterior estimates for the Gibbs sampler as well as convergence problems that may arise from choosing vague priors. Finally, the proposed methods are illustrated with both simulation and real data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Acidification has sparked discussion about whether regulatory agencies should place coastal waters on the Clean Water Act 303(d) impaired water bodies list. Here we describe scientific challenges in assessing impairment with existing data, exploring use of both pH and biological criteria. Application of pH criteria is challenging because present coastal pH levels fall within the allowable criteria range, but the existing criteria allow for pH levels that are known to cause extensive biological damage. Moreover, some states express their water quality criteria as change from natural conditions, but the spatio-temporal distribution and quality of existing coastal pH data are insufficient to define natural condition. Biological criteria require that waters be of sufficient quality to support resident biological communities and are relevant because a number of biological communities have declined over the last several decades. However, the scientific challenge is differentiating those declines from natural population cycles and positively associating them with acidification-related water quality stress. We present two case studies, one for pteropods and one for oysters, which illustrate the opportunities, challenges and uncertainties associated with implementing biological criteria. The biggest challenge associated with these biological assessments is lack of co-location between long-term biological and chemical monitoring, which inhibits the ability to connect biological response with an acidification stressor. Developing new, ecologically relevant water quality criteria for acidification and augmenting coastal water monitoring at spatio-temporal scales appropriate to those criteria would enhance opportunities for effective use of water quality regulations.},

abstract = {Ecosystem services provided by dense populations of filter-feeding bivalves include the potential for sequestration of nutrients acquired by feeding on phytoplankton whose growth is stimulated by urban and suburban nutrient input. Using transplanted oysters, Crassostrea virginica, the potential of using an aquaculture approach to grow, harvest, and therefore remove nitrogen from coastal bays with high nutrient input was studied. Jamaica Bay-urban high nitrogen input (input ∼5.8 × 10s kgN/y)-was contrasted with Great South Bay-suburban and medium nitrogen input (input ∼8.5 × 105 kgN/y)-both located on the south shore of western Long Island, NY. A growth period of June-October was used with a harvest in October as the basis for an estimate, and nitrogen in soft tissues and shell was measured in October, minus the starting values, because both tissue and shell would be removed at the time of harvest. Nitrogen sequestration potential was determined from growth in aquaculture cages, extrapolated to 50{\%} cage coverage over a range of areas in each bay. In the extreme case of total suitable habitat coverage, oysters in Jamaica Bay could extract a total of ∼61{\%} of nitrogen input, and 47{\%} if 5,000 acres were covered; whereas impressive, the oysters could not be sold for food and the cost of such a plan would be prohibitive. In Great South Bay, aquaculture covering 5,000 acres would take up 148{\%} of the nitrogen input, which is encouraging because aquaculture leases are beginning to be awarded in this bay and most waters are clean enough for harvest and human consumption. The results suggest that an aquaculture-based oyster fishery might compensate for the nonpoint source nitrogen input that is common in many estuaries where nitrogen input is moderate and sewer systems are not present.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in estuaries induces high phytoplankton production, contributing to coastal eutrophication. Abundant natural banks of filter feeders, such as bivalves, in downstream areas may contribute to reducing symptoms of eutrophication by decreasing phytoplankton biomass and amount of material subjected to microbial regeneration. The current concern is to what extent bivalves can control water quality and how environmental parameters can influence the filtration process and vice versa. In the present study Crassostrea rhizophorae (Guilding, 1818) grazing ability on suspended particles in their natural environment was determined in situ, using the biodeposition method and uniquely constructed sediment traps. Additionally the effect of body size on effective clearance rate (ECR) was examined using three different size groups. The experiment was conducted in the Piraqu{\^{e}}-a{\c{c}}u/Piraqu{\^{e}}-mirim estuary system, (Aracruz, ES, Brazil) during the second week of June 2012 (dry season). Environmental parameters were measured together with total particulate matter (TPM, mg L-1) and chlorophyll a analysis (CHL, $\mu$g L-1) at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. Average values recorded for TPM and CHL were 5.79mg L-1 and 2.55$\mu$g L-1 respectively with very high organic seston fraction (80{\%}). The reported effective clearance rate (ECR, in litres per hour) was 17.99L h-1g-1 dry weight (DW), one of the highest reported in literature and can be associated with a high detritus content and different feeding strategies in comparison to bivalves residing in temperate environments. Weight and length (height) relationship were closely correlated (r=0.73) however, clearance rate (ECR) standardized to 1g dry tissue weight did not vary significantly among different size classes. High ECR at high particulate organic matter (POM, {\%}) supports the belief that bivalves can exhibit ECR flexibility according to food quality.},

abstract = {Benthic suspension feeders depend on the fluid medium for their supply of edible particles. The horizontal flux of organic seston is a function of the interaction of particles of varying densities with the near-bed velocity field. Analytical and numerical models of this process predict that the shape of the flux profile varies with flow rate, bottom roughness and particle settling velocity. Bulk horizontal particle flux may either decrease or increase with height above the bed. Flume experiments with natural sediments from Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia confirmed the trends predicted by the model. In a complex suspension, denser, inorganic particles have flux maxima closer to the bed than lighter, organic seston, so suspension feeders must reach several centimeters above bed level to maximize the organic composition of their ration. Examination of the feeding ecology and diet of a passive suspension feeder, the polychaete Spio setosa, suggested that it is adapted to feed at 4-5 cm above the bed and specializes on suspended macrophyte detritus and flocculated organic-mineral aggregates. The influx of this organic seston at Eastern Passage is periodic and coincident with the local seiche period.-from Author},

abstract = {There are few data on Crassostrea virginica physiological rates across the range of salinities and temperatures to which they are regularly exposed, and this limits the applicability of growth and production models using these data. The objectives of this study were to quantify, in winter (17 °C) and summer (27 °C), the clearance and oxygen consumption rates of C. virginica from Louisiana across a range of salinities typical of the region (3, 6, 9, 15 and 25). Salinity and season (temperature and reproduction) affected C. virginica physiology differently; salinity impacted clearance rates with reduced feeding rates at low salinities, while season had a strong effect on respiration rates. Highest clearance rates were found at salinities of 9–25, with reductions ranging from 50 to 80 and 90 to 95{\%} at salinities of 6 and 3, respectively. Oxygen consumption rates in summer were four times higher than in winter. Oxygen consumption rates were within a narrow range and similar among salinities in winter, but varied greatly among individuals and salinities in summer. This likely reflected varying stages of gonad development. Valve movements measured at the five salinities indicated oysters were open 50–60{\%} of the time in the 6–25 salinity range and {\~{}} 30{\%} at a salinity of 3. Reduced opening periods, concomitant with narrower valve gap amplitudes, are in accord with the limited feeding at the lowest salinity (3). These data indicate the need for increased focus on experimental determination of optimal ranges and thresholds to better quantify oyster population responses to environmental changes.},

abstract = {We studied the composition of the {\textless}25 $\mu$m seston size fraction as a food resource potentially available to suspension feeding ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa, over an annual cycle in Canary Creek saltmarsh, Delaware Bay. There were significant seasonal variations in the concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and total carbohydrate, but not cellulose. The concentration of cellulose, measured by hydrolytic cellulase enzyme assay, was relatively low (seasonal range 24 to 35 $\mu$gl-1) and only comprised from 3{\%} of total carbohydrate in May 1996 to 13{\%} in November 1995. We used the biomass of microalgae, estimated from chlorophyll a, and abundance of free-living bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates to calculate each component's equivalent carbon content. Microalgae were the most dominant carbon source (62{\%} annually) among the four identified components (phytoplankton, bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and cellulose) in all seasons except in August 1995 when carbon from bacteria was most abundant (55{\%}). The annual average carbon equivalents of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and cellulose were relatively small (2 and 4{\%}, respectively). The total concentration of POC in the seston was much greater than the carbon derived from the four identified components. The proportions that these identified components contributed to POC varied seasonally and combined only accounted for 8-24{\%} of POC. Based on these estimates, the bulk of the POC in Canary Creek marsh was not associated with any of the four components we identified. We suggest that this uncharacterized material was some type of non-lignocellulosic, amorphous detritus of unknown utility as a food resource for ribbed mussels. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Perhaps evidencing a bias toward subtidal reefs, this set of parameters omits another first-order environmental factor, tidal emersion. Intertidal oyster reefs can be the dominant reef habitat in estuaries, with clear zonation in oyster performance across the intertidal exposure gradient. Therefore, we propose to include tidal emersion as a fourth universal environmental parameter when designing and evaluating oyster restoration projects to better encompass the whole environmental spectrum along which reefs occur.},

Typically, all the factors that affect ecological processes are not measured and included in the statistical models used to investigate relationships between variables associated with those processes. As a consequence, there may be a weak or no predictive relationship between the mean of the response variable (y) distribution and the measured predictive factors (X). Yet there may be stronger, useful predictive relationships with other parts of the response variable distribution. This primer relates quantile regression estimates to prediction intervals in parametric error distribution regression models (eg least squares), and discusses the ordering characteristics, interval nature, sampling variation, weighting, and interpretation of the estimates for homogeneous and heterogeneous regression models.},

abstract = {The pattern of somatic growth of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas cultured in suspension in Geoje–Hansan Bay, Korea was evaluated between July 2013 and March 2014 comparing culturing sites and depths. Gross biochemical composition of oyster tissues provided a measure of physiological status, and clearance rates of oysters provided a measure of feeding physiology at different water flow speeds. A growth curve model indicated greater tissue growth in the surface than in the bottom layers, and advanced summer growth by more than 4 months in the stagnant inner bay compared with winter growth in the more rapidly flowing outer bay. Our results suggest that rapid tissue growth of oysters in the surface layer in summer is supported by high primary productivity in the inner bay. In contrast, oyster growth performance at the outer bay in late fall and winter may be related to seasonal food availability that is regulated by short residence time and thereby rapid renewal of water compared to the inner bay. Furthermore, a combination of the water flow regime of the bay and the flow rate-dependent feeding physiology of oysters proved to be an important determinant of seasonal growth dynamics. Finally, oyster growth was better explained by water flow rates than by hydrographic conditions.},

Conditions included natural seawater enhanced, on occasion, with variable additions of microalgal monoculture and/or natural silt collected from the surface of nearby mudflats, thereby ensuring that diets ranged from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic ({\textgreater}325 µg chlorophyll a/L) and highly turbid ({\textgreater}1,250 mg total particulate matter/L). Building on past insights into differential particle processing, we resolved the availability, filtration, and ingestion of organic matter rich in chlorophyll a, and which matter is known to be ingested selectively, from all remaining organics, such as detritus, bacteria, protozoans, and/or colloids. The forms of fitted relations that best described feeding responses were different for chlorophyll-rich versus remaining organics, that difference being consistent in all eight bivalve species, including when measured in the same species across different locations. Throughout, positive linear relations between net ingestion of chlorophyll-rich organic matter and the availability of that chlorophyll-rich organic matter indicated that each species ingested constant proportions of the organics associated with chlorophyll a, with no limitation evident to such ingestion over our experimental range. Alternatively, ingestion of the remaining organics by each species increased as saturating functions of the availability of those remaining organics alone. Differences were evident between species both in the proportions of available chlorophyll-rich organic matter that were ingested and in saturated ingestion rates for the remaining organics. Comparison of those differences suggests an evolutionary trade-off among species between their relative abilities to process chlorophyll-rich versus remaining organics. Differences also suggest congeneric adaptation to natural habitat, impressing a need for careful appraisal of each and every bivalve species. Significant costs of particle sorting, digestion, and absorption, evidenced as metabolically derived material egested and assayed within feces, were greatest in species with higher saturated capacities for the ingestion of remaining organics. Last, we describe how, compared with predictions based on chlorophyll a or total particulate organic matter alone, our approach resolving coincident differential availabilities and processing of chlorophyll-rich versus remaining organic matter has improved the accuracy of growth simulations when applying single calibrations of the generic shellfish model ShellSIM across coastal habitats that contrast in seston composition.},

abstract = {Harvesting may be a potent driver of demographic change and contemporary evolution, which both may have great impacts on animal populations. Research has focused on changes in phenotypic traits that are easily quantifiable and for which time series exist, such as size, age, sex, or gonad size, whereas potential changes in behavioural traits have been under-studied. Here, we analyse potential drivers of long-term changes in a behavioural trait for the Northeast Arctic stock of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, namely choice of spawning location. For 104 years (1866-1969), commercial catches were recorded annually and reported by county along the Norwegian coast. During this time period, spawning ground distribution has fluctuated with a trend towards more northerly spawning. Spawning location is analysed against a suite of explanatory factors including climate, fishing pressure, density dependence, and demography. We find that demography (age or age at maturation) had the highest explanatory power for variation in spawning location, while climate had a limited effect below statistical significance. As to potential mechanisms, some effects of climate may act through demography, and explanatory variables for demography may also have absorbed direct evolutionary change in migration distance for which proxies were unavailable. Despite these caveats, we argue that fishing mortality, either through demographic or evolutionary change, has served as an effective driver for changing spawning locations in cod, and that additional explanatory factors related to climate add no significant information.},

abstract = {The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas varies dramatically in density throughout its introduced range in the northeast Pacific; this could be driven by environmental constraints or by species interactions that change across habitats. I studied the effects of native species on this invader across a range of environmental contexts where it is common (mid-intertidal zone, low wave exposure) vs. where it is rare (low intertidal zone, high wave exposure) in Barkley Sound, Vancouver Island, Canada. I carried out factorial manipulations of 2 guilds of native species (neighbors, i.e. filter feeders such as mussels and barnacles, and predators such as crabs and whelks) and recorded survival and linear shell growth of transplanted, newly settled oysters (juveniles similar to 1 cm in size). C. gigas responded dramatically to tidal elevation: growth improved but survival declined at lower elevations, where feeding time and predation were greater. Wave exposure reduced shell growth over 2 mo from 11.4 mm at protected sites to 7.2 mm at exposed sites, but variation in survival was not statistically significant. Both guilds of native species exerted biotic resistance: predators reduced oyster survival and neighbors reduced growth. Surprisingly, neighbors improved oyster survival at some wave-exposed sites, thereby facilitating one demographic variable related to invasion while restricting another. Finally, predation had equivalent effects on survival at wave-exposed and protected sites, although different predators were probably involved. Post-recruitment phenomena were unable to account for variation in oyster density across sites, and propagule pressure is a likely driver instead. Abiotic and biotic factors jointly contributed to the risk of proliferation of a non-native species, and in this case their influence was often (on growth) but not always (on survival) additive.},

abstract = {The Pacific oyster Magallana gigas, globally one of the most translocated marine species, has never been commercially farmed in any part of the Croatian eastern Adriatic Sea, where the native flat oyster Ostrea edulis is the only cultured oyster species. The Pacific oyster has, however, established populations on the west coast of the Istria peninsula, in the northeast Adriatic Sea. Current distribution, abundance and size structure of the flat and Pacific oysters were studied there along spatial and depth gradients in natural and artificial habitats to assess their potential for coexistence. This is the first quantitative assessment of native and non-native oyster populations on a Mediterranean-wide scale providing a baseline for determining future changes in their distribution. Both species were omnipresent, with the Pacific oyster displaying a more pronounced variability in abundance and size in relation to survey regions and depths. The population density of flat oysters was low, generally less than 1 individual/m2, with no difference among regions. The density of the Pacific oyster was significantly higher, being on average 5 individuals/m2. Dense, reef-forming aggregations of Pacific oysters were contained in Lim Bay, a nationally-important shellfish aquaculture area, where its mean density was 107 individuals/m2. Along the open coastline its densities were considerably lower and followed a latitudinal gradient. The observed abundance and size distribution patterns of the Pacific oyster suggest that Lim Bay was the introduction point, with feral settlement likely originating from short-lived experimental aquaculture trials and subsequently dispersing by prevailing local currents. The flat oysters were larger in size and settled at different depths compared to the Pacific oysters. The vertical range of Pacific oysters was mostly contained in the tidal zone, while flat oysters were present in the subtidal exclusively. Such spatial partitioning likely resulted from introduced oysters occupying a vacant ecological niche and not due to interspecific competitive exclusion. Habitat type had a strong effect on proliferation of Pacific oysters. Artificial hard substrata harboured more abundant and larger Pacific oysters than the natural rocky shore habitat. The possibility of multiple local introduction pathways in ports and marinas is also discussed. Currently, there seems to be no spatial competition between the two oyster species, but as it is hard to predict future possible impacts of non-native species, we strongly suggest regular monitoring of the Pacific oyster, prioritising sensitive and protected areas as well as areas at the edge of its distribution.},

abstract = {Restoration of degraded ecosystems is an important societal goal, yet inadequate monitoring and the absence of clear performance metrics are common criticisms of many habitat restoration projects. Funding limitations can prevent adequate monitoring, but we suggest that the lack of accepted metrics to address the diversity of restoration objectives also presents a serious challenge to the monitoring of restoration projects. A working group with experience in designing and monitoring oyster reef projects was used to develop standardized monitoring metrics, units, and performance criteria that would allow for comparison among restoration sites and projects of various construction types. A set of four universal metrics (reef areal dimensions, reef height, oyster density, and oyster size-frequency distribution) and a set of three universal environmental variables (water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) are recommended to be monitored for all oyster habitat restoration projects regardless of their goal(s). In addition, restoration goal-based metrics specific to four commonly cited ecosystem service-based restoration goals are recommended, along with an optional set of seven supplemental ancillary metrics that could provide information useful to the interpretation of prerestoration and postrestoration monitoring data. Widespread adoption of a common set of metrics with standardized techniques and units to assess well-defined goals not only allows practitioners to gauge the performance of their own projects but also allows for comparison among projects, which is both essential to the advancement of the field of oyster restoration and can provide new knowledge about the structure and ecological function of oyster reef ecosystems.},

abstract = {Previous field studies have demonstrated that sedimentation is an important factor that can limit oyster reef growth and restoration success. High relief reefs are more productive and resilient than low relief reefs, in part, because increasing reef height reduces sedimentation and enhances oyster growth. In this study, we investigated the relationship between initial reef height and reef development using a simple model. The model contains three coupled differential equations that describe changes in oyster volume, shell volume, and sediment volume per unit area of reef with time. The model was used to investigate how parameters such as flow speed, sediment grain size, and food concentration affect reef survival and final reef height. Whether or not a reef survives depends primarily on the shape of the sediment concentration profile relative to the initial reef height. Over a long time period, three different steady-state reef heights are possible, depending on the environmental parameters and initial reef height: (1) If growth outpaces sedimentation, the reef achieves the maximum possible height, which is independent of sedimentation parameters; (2) if deposition outpaces growth and the shear stress does not exceed the critical shear stress, the reef is buried in sediment and dies; and (3) if deposition outpaces growth and the shear stress exceeds the critical shear stress, a reduced steady-state height is achieved that depends on both growth and sedimentation parameters. The model can be used to assess the ways in which measurable environmental parameters affect reef restoration success.},

abstract = {Eutrophication often causes hypoxia in estuarine and coastal systems, but the mechanisms that control hypoxic events vary among estuaries and are often difficult to discern. We monitored surface and bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Upper Newport Bay (UNB), a tidally mixed estuary in southern California subject to anthropogenic nutrient loading, eutrophication and hypoxia. Our goal was to identify the environmental factors regulating DO dynamics. Six hypoxic events occurred between June and November and were associated with a combination of low solar radiation, increased freshwater discharge following precipitation, and enhanced haline stratification during reduced tidal range periods. At the head of the estuary, high macroalgal biomass and pronounced haline stratification resulted in high DO in the surface layer and low DO in the bottom layer. Oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor waters were transported down-estuary by ebb tides, resulting in DO heterogeneity throughout the UNB. Cross-wavelet analysis illustrated the down-estuary propagation of high/low DO signal correlated with the phases of diurnal photosynthetic and semi-diurnal tidal cycles. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated this issue in the oyster Crassostrea gigas using three different methods at different time scales in two traditional oyster farming areas of the French Atlantic Coast, the Bay of Arcachon and Marennes-Ol{\'{e}}ron. We directly recorded spawning at high temporal resolution using high-frequency non-invasive (HFNI) valvometry from 2007–2014 and measured the dry mass and oyster larvae abundance in 2008 and 2009. We analyzed a 29-yr series of oyster D-larvae numbers in the Bay of Arcachon (1982–2010). By combining these three approaches, we demonstrated that during the summer months at both sites, spawning in C. gigas occurs in the morning or during the evening, essentially at high tide of perigean spring tides, independent of the positions of these oysters, above or below the lowest water level. We characterized the associated water currents at the spawning location in the Bay of Arcachon and observed that spawning systematically occurs during the early phase of a water current peak, at the beginning of ebbing. We propose that this water current peak acts as a final trigger for spawning. These results have ecological consequences associated with gamete encounters and the dispersal of fertilized eggs (zygotes).},

abstract = {Oysters are ecosystem engineers that create biogenic reef habitat important to estuarine biodiversity, benthic-pelagic coupling, and fishery production. Prevailing explanations for the dramatic decline of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) during the last century overlook ecosystem complexity by ignoring interactions among multiple environmental disturbances. To explain oyster loss, we tested whether (1) mortality of oysters on natural oyster reefs varies with water depth (3 m rs. 6 m), (2) harvesting by oyster dredges reduces the height of oyster reefs, and (3) bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia and reduction in reef height through fishery disturbance interact to enhance mortality of oysters in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. The percentage of oysters found dead (mean ± 1 SD) during a survey of natural reefs in May 1993 was significantly greater at 6-m (92 ± 10{\%}) than at 3-m (28 ± 9{\%}) water depth. Less than one season's worth of oyster dredging reduced the height of restored oyster reefs by {\~{}}30{\%}. During stratification of the water column in summer, oxygen depletion near the seafloor at 6 m caused mass mortality of oysters, other invertebrates, and fishes on short, deep experimental reefs, while oysters and other reef associates elevated into the surface layer by sufficient reef height or by location in shallow water survived. Highly mobile blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) abandoned burrows located in hypoxic/anoxic bottom waters but remained alive in shallow water. Our results indicate that interaction of reef habitat degradation (height reduction) through fishery disturbance and extended bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia caused the pattern of oyster mortality observed on natural reefs and influences the abundance and distribution of fish and invertebrate species that utilize this temperate reef habitat. Interactions among environmental disturbances imply a need for the integrative approaches of ecosystem management to restore and sustain estuarine habitat.},

Once the focus of a fishery, they have not been commercially harvested since the 1930s because of stock declines and a shift in focus to nonindigenous oysters. Olympia oysters were reported from Juan de Fuca Strait, Strait of Georgia, West Coast Vancouver Island, Queen Charlotte Strait and North Coast areas to approximately 5213{\#}N. They were only characterized as abundant at sites in the North Coast and West Coast Vancouver Island. Systematic quantitative sampling has not been undertaken in BC, but the few sites surveyed had estimated densities higher than others in the literature. Biological sampling was also rare in BC, and size distributions suggest that regular, low level recruitment occurs at some sites. The low incidence of brooding oysters is likely an artifact of sampling too soon in the reproductive season. Olympia oysters were listed as special concern species by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2000 and under the Canadian Species At Risk Act (SARA) in 2003. Some measures have been taken to protect Olympia oysters from further decline: no commercial fishery exists or is contemplated at this time, the bag limit in the recreational fishery was reduced to zero in 2007, regulations are in place and proposed that will prohibit the use of tributyltin antifouling paints in Canada and basic protection is afforded within Federal and Provincial parks.

abstract = {Geospatial habitat suitability index (HSI) models have emerged as powerful tools that integrate pertinent spatial information to guide habitat restoration efforts, but have rarely accounted for spatial variation in ecosystem service provision. In this study, we utilized satellite-derived chlorophyll a concentrations for Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA in conjunction with data on water flow velocities and dissolved oxygen concentrations to identify potential restoration locations that would maximize the oyster reef-associated ecosystem service of water filtration. We integrated these novel factors associated with oyster water filtration ecosystem services within an existing, ‘Metapopulation Persistence' focused GIS-based, HSI model containing biophysical (e.g., salinity, oyster larval connectivity) and logistical (e.g., distance to nearest restoration material stockpile site) factors to identify suitable locations for oyster restoration that maximize long-term persistence of restored oyster populations and water filtration ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, we compared the ‘Water Filtration' optimized HSI with the HSI optimized for ‘Metapopulation Persistence,' as well as a hybrid model that optimized for both water filtration and metapopulation persistence. Optimal restoration locations (i.e., locations corresponding to the top 1{\%} of suitability scores) were identified that were consistent among the three HSI scenarios (i.e., “win-win” locations), as well as optimal locations unique to a given HSI scenario (i.e., “tradeoff” locations). The modeling framework utilized in this study can provide guidance to restoration practitioners to maximize the cost-efficiency and ecosystem services value of habitat restoration efforts. Furthermore, the functional relationships between oyster water filtration and chlorophyll a concentrations, water flow velocities, and dissolved oxygen applied in this study can guide field- and lab-testing of hypotheses related to optimal conditions for oyster reef restoration to maximize water quality enhancement benefits.},

The sonde can be made without specialized tools or training and can be easily modified to meet individual application requirements. The platform allows for internal logging of multiple parameters of which conductivity, temperature, and GPS position are demonstrated. Two design configurations for different coastal hydrographic applications are highlighted to show the robust and versatile nature of this sensor platform. The initial sonde design was intended for use on a Lagrangian style surface drifter that recorded measurements of temperature; salinity; and position for a deployment duration of less than 24 h. Functional testing of the sensor consisted of a 55 h comparison with a regularly maintained water quality sensor (i.e., YSI 6600 sonde) in Mobile Bay, AL. The temperature and salinity data were highly correlated and had acceptable RMS errors of 0.154 degreeC and 1.35 psu for the environmental conditions. A second application using the sonde platform was designed for longer duration ({\~{}}3-4 weeks); subsurface (1.5-4.0 m depths) deployment, moored to permanent structures. Design alterations reflected an emphasis on minimizing power consumption, which included the elimination of the GPS capabilities, increased battery capacity, and power-saving software modifications. The sonde designs presented serve as templates that will expand the hydrographic measurement capabilities of ocean scientists, students, and teachers.},

Numerous authors have commented and criticized its use as a means to identify scientific importance of results and have called for an end to using the term “statistical significance.” Recent articles in Estuaries and Coasts were evaluated for reliance on the use of statistical significance and reporting errors were identified. Suggestions are made for improving what is reported related to statistical testing. Focus should be on scientific importance of estimates, estimation of the size of the effect and the certainty in the size of the effect instead of simply reporting a p-value and relying on hypothesis tests.},

abstract = {Native oyster reefs once dominated many estuaries, ecologically and economically. Centuries of resource extraction exacerbated by coastal degradation have pushed oyster reefs to the brink of functional extinction worldwide. We examined the condition of oyster reefs across 144 bays and 44 ecoregions; our comparisons of past with present abundances indicate that more than 90{\%} of them have been lost in bays (70{\%}) and ecoregions (63{\%}). In many bays, more than 99{\%} of oyster reefs have been lost and are functionally extinct. Overall, we estimate that 85{\%} of oyster reefs have been lost globally. Most of the world's remaining wild capture of native oysters 75{\%}) comes from just five ecoregions in North America, yet the condition of reefs in these ecoregions is poor at best, except in the Gulf of Mexico. We identify many cost-effective solutions for conservation, restoration, and the management of fisheries and nonnative species that could reverse these oyster losses and restore reef ecosystem services.},

@article{Ruesink2003,
abstract = {We examined the relationship between variation in origin of organic matter and benthic secondary production in a shallow, macrotidal estuary on the United States Pacific Northwest coast, Willapa Bay, Washington. Spatial variation in energy sources and benthic productivity were investigated at both local (vertical height and cross-bank components) and regional (sites within the bay) scales. We determined the stable carbon isotope ratios of oysters (Crassostrea gigas) to evaluate marine versus terrestrial energy sources, compared growth rates of oysters, and made time series measurements of physical variables at estuarine channel and intertidal stations. The stable carbon isotope ratios of oysters ranged from -22parts per thousand in inner portions of the estuary to -18parts per thousand near the mouth and oysters grown on the substrate surface were enriched in delta(13)C relative to those grown in the water column. These patterns are consistent with terrigenous inputs away from the estuary mouth and benthic microalgae in the diets of on-bottom oysters. The highest oyster growth was found at an inner estuary site where riverine inputs are relatively high and coincided with high ammonium in the water column. However, for most sites in Willapa Bay, oyster growth actually declined away from the estuary mouth. Reducing the time available for feeding by transplanting oysters higher in the intertidal zone had significant negative effects on growth (e.g., a reduction of 27-35{\%} over 0.5 m). Despite the fact that oysters grown on-bottom had access to different resources than those in the water column, their growth was slower at any given tidal elevation, which may be due to on-bottom competition with other suspension feeders, boundary layer effects, or interference from turbidity. In a practical sense, oyster growers have been adjusting to allochthonous energetic support of food webs in Willapa Bay for more than a century, because they have traditionally moved oysters from southern parts of the bay where recruitment is relatively high to beds where market-size oysters can be grown closer to the mouth. This study provides mechanistic support for these practices and suggests that climatic events on a variety of temporal scales (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, upwelling events) could have economic consequences for aquaculture.},

abstract = {Amylase activity variation in the guts of several model organisms appears to be explained by amylase gene copy number variation. We tested the hypothesis that amylase gene copy number is al-ways elevated in animals with high amylolytic activity. We there-fore sequenced the amylase genes and examined amylase gene copy number in prickleback fishes (family Stichaeidae) with dif-ferent diets including two species of convergently evolved her-bivores with the elevated amylase activity phenotype. We found elevated amylase gene copy number (six haploid copies) with se-quence variation among copies in one herbivore (Cebidichthys violaceus) and modest gene copy number (two to three haploid copies) with little sequence variation in the remaining taxa, which included herbivores, omnivores, and a carnivore. Few functional differences in amylase biochemistry were observed, and previous investigations showed similar digestibility among the conver-gently evolved herbivores with differing amylase genetics. Hence, the phenotype of elevated amylase activity can be achieved by different mechanisms (i.e., elevated expression of fewer genes, in-creased gene copy number, or expression of more efficient amy-lase proteins) with similar results. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses of available fish amylase genes show mostly lineage-specific duplication events leading to gene copy number variation, although a whole-genome duplication event or chro-mosomal translocation may have produced multiple amylase cop-ies in the Ostariophysi, again showing multiple routes to the same result.},

abstract = {Despite the abundance of literature on organismal responses to multiple environmental stressors, most studies have not matched the timing of experimental manipulations with the temporal pattern of stressors in nature. We test the interactive effects of diel-cycling hypoxia with both warming and decreased salinities using ecologically realistic exposures. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of negative synergistic effects on Olympia oyster growth; rather, we found only additive and opposing effects of hypoxia (detrimental) and warming (beneficial). We suspect that diel-cycling provided a temporal refuge that allowed physiological compensation. We also tested for latent effects of warming and hypoxia to low-salinity tolerance using a seasonal delay between stressor events. However, we did not find a latent effect, rather a threshold survival response to low salinity that was independent of early life-history exposure to warming or hypoxia. The absence of synergism is likely the result of stressor treatments that mirror the natural timing of environmental stressors. We provide environmental context for laboratory experimental data by examining field time series environmental data from four North American west coast estuaries and find heterogeneous environmental signals that characterize each estuary, suggesting that the potential stressor exposure to oysters will drastically differ over moderate spatial scales. This heterogeneity implies that efforts to conserve and restore oysters will require an adaptive approach that incorporates knowledge of local conditions. We conclude that studies of multiple environmental stressors can be greatly improved by integrating ecologically realistic exposure and timing of stressors found in nature with organismal life-history traits.},

abstract = {With the inhalant siphon facing into the flow, and with adequate seston levels, water velocity has a significant negative linear effect on mussel exhalant siphon area, but no significant effect on valve gape. Mussel filtration rates of polystyrene beads, measured by ingestion, were three times less at 30 cm s-1 than at 10 cm s-1, and they mirrored the trends observed with the exhalant siphon area. However, with the inhalant siphon oriented downstream of flow direction at the two higher flow speeds (20 and 30 cm s-1), there was no significant effect of velocity on exhalant siphon area. There was also a significant positive effect of particle concentration on mussel exhalant siphon area. In contrast to the effects of velocity, mussel valve gape responses to increasing particle concentrations mirrored the responses of the exhalant siphon aperture. The thresholds for the initiation of active pumping, opening the valve gape, extending the mantle and opening the exhalant siphon are at minimum seston levels of about 4 × 103 particles ml-1, or particle volumes of about 1.0 mm3 1-1. Thus, the closure of valves in the relatively non-turbid waters of Maine indicates insufficient food particle concentrations for feeding. Increases in exhalant siphon area caused by particle volume increases from 1 to 5 mm3 1-1, or particle concentrations from 6 × 103 to 4 × 104 particles ml-1, indicate that blue mussels respond to increasing ambient food concentrations by increasing their pumping rates. These results demonstrate that exhalant siphon area has potential for the quantitative remote sensing of feeding rate, and that valve gape is a more indirect measure of activity with respect to minimum concentrations for the initiation of feeding. Maintaining an open valve gape with partial or full closure of the exhalant siphon under high flow conditions is similar to the response of blue mussels to changes in salinity, and is interpreted with respect to increased oxygen diffusion for respiration. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal variation in the supply of suspended chlorophyll a in the Eel River, Nova Scotia, Canada was examined in relation to the feeding regime of bivalve molluscs. Estuarine circulation patterns were deduced from semi-synoptic profiles of tidal height, salinity and chlorophyll a concentration. Steep horizontal gradients in salinity and chlorophyll a were found to be generated from tidally-driven circulation and autochthonous algal production. Measurements of the flux of chlorophyll a through the mouth of the Eel River demonstrated a substantially greater supply of material past sedentary organisms during ebb than during flood flow. A large net export of chlorophyll a from the estuary to the near-shore zone occurred during all tidal cycles. These spatio-temporal gradients in food supply resulted in large quantitative differences in ration to benthic organisms living at different sites and tidal elevations within the estuary. To investigate the effect of this variation in food supply on possible seston depletion, a simple depletion model was developed and the results compared to a field experiment. The model links physical advection to biological filtering, and the results suggest that, during half of the tidal cycle, the retention of water over the bivalves was shorter than that required for clearance of a significant fraction of the suspended load by the filter-feeders. Relatively large depletion of seston was likely to occur only during low volume transport at low water, at which time bivalves were potentially food-limited. In the field experiment, measurements of algal concentration and flux were made over a dense bed of the infaunal bivalve Mya arenaria ({\~{}}103ind. m-2, 240 g ADW m-2). Evidence supporting depletion was found in only one of seven comparisons of algal concentration before and after passage over the bivalve bed. The clams did not measurably affect the flux of chlorophyll a. Depletion was not observed during two of three periods of favorable conditions, a result which may be explained by bivalve feeding behavior. In this small estuary, spatio-temporal variation in food resources, generated by hydrodynamic forcing, the source of algal production and the location of bivalves, results in a large range of feeding regimes within a single system.},

abstract = {The importance of asymmetric tidal cycles in the transport and accumulation of sediment in shallow well-mixed estuaries is well established. Along the U.S. Atlantic Coast, tidal amplitude, bottom friction, and system geometry determine tidal distortion as documented at 54 tide gauges in 26 tidally dominated estuaries of varying geometry having negligible freshwater inflow. Analyses of sea-surface heights are compared to the results of one-dimensional numerical modelling to clarify the physics of tidal response in well-mixed estuaries. Concise measurements of estuarine geometry and ocean tidal range are used to predict consistently the nature of tidal sea-surface distortion. Numerical modelling then is utilized to extend theoretical and observational relationships between geometry and sea-height to predict trends in velocity distortion and near-bed sediment transport. Non-linear tidal distortion is a composite of two principal effects: (1) frictional interaction between the tide and channel bottoms (reflected in a h = tidal amplitude channel depth) causes relatively shorter floods; (2) intertidal storage (measured by Vs Vc = volume of intertidal storage volume of channels at mean sea level) causes relatively shorter ebbs. Variations in Vs Vc and a h trigger consistent and predictable changes in tidal distortion as measured through the first harmonic of the principal tidal constitutent. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {Ribbed mussels occupy multiple habitats across the salt marsh landscape—along primary low marsh shorelines, within tidal creeks, and across the high marsh platform. Through their filter-feeding activity, ribbed mussels contribute to nutrient cycling and facilitate vertical accretion. Although abundant, the spatial distribution of ribbed mussels and their habitats vary within and among marshes, affecting the landscape-level distribution of their filtration activity. This study's objective was to assess the spatial variability of ribbed mussel filtration within and among three salt marshes in New Jersey (NJ) and one in Rhode Island (RI). The distribution of mussel populations and habitats per marsh were quantified through field surveys and GIS extrapolation. Gross filtration rates of total suspended solids and particulate nitrogen, normalized for mussel dry tissue biomass, were assessed for each habitat per marsh and adjusted for feeding time. Gross filtration rates were not driven solely by mussel biomass, but also by food availability and relative habitat proportion. Particulate nitrogen removal was estimated to be between 68 and 166 kg ha−1 year−1 in NJ marshes and 39 kg ha−1 year−1 in the RI marsh, and filtered materials were estimated to contribute between 1.16–2.78 mm year−1 and 0.83 mm year−1 to vertical enhancements in NJ and RI marshes, respectively. Filtration activity was predominantly concentrated in creeks ({\textgreater} 65{\%}), but was lower along primary marsh shorelines in the New Jersey marshes ({\textless} 10{\%}) relative to the Rhode Island marsh ({\textgreater} 25{\%}), suggesting a habitat-specific filtration deficiency along the primary tidal channels of NJ marshes.},

abstract = {Nothofagaceae (southern beeches) are a relatively small flowering plant family of trees confined to the Southern Hemisphere. The fossil record of the family is abundant and it has been widely used as a test case for the classic hypothesis that Antarctica, Patagonia, Australia and New Zealand were once joined together. Although the phylogenetic relationships in Nothofagus appear to be well supported, the evolution of some pollen morphological traits remains elusive, largely because of the lack of ultrastructural analyses. Here we describe the pollen morphology of all extant South American species of Nothofagus, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and light microscopy (LM), and reconstruct ancestral character states using a well-supported phylogenetic tree of the family. Our results indicate that the main differences between pollen of subgenera Fuscospora (pollen type fusca a) and Nothofagus (pollen type fusca b) are related to the size of microspines (distinguishable or not in optical section), and the thickening of colpi margins (thickened inwards, or thickened both inwards and outwards). In particular, Nothofagus alessandrii, the only extant South American species of subgenus Fuscospora, presents distinctive pollen features that have not been observed in any other species of the genus (i.e. a large granular infratectum and spongy apertural endexine). Species of subgenus Lophozonia are characterized by having the largest pollen grains, with polygonal outline in polar view, microspines distinguishable in optical section, long and non-thickened colpi, and a thin endexine. The reconstruction of character states for the node corresponding to the common ancestor to genus Nothofagus leads us to conclude that the ancestral form of Nothofagaceae should have had: equatorial diameter {\textless} 40 $\mu$m, circular outline in polar view, microspines distinguishable in optical section, short colpi thickened inwards, and a thin endexine. These features are fully consistent with those present in Nothofagidites senectus Dettmann {\&} Playford, the oldest fossil species of Nothofagaceae recorded in Campanian-Maastrichtian sediments of Gondwana.},

abstract = {Time lags can be found throughout the invasion process, including in the arrival, establishment, and impacts of invaders. While we often lack the information necessary to generate quantitative expectations of invader performance, some types of lags are not surprising. For example, populations often grow exponentially in the early phases of invasion, and this will give rise to an inherent lag. More broadly, early rates of anthropogenic invasion were much slower than what we are now witnessing, but as the vectors of invasion have also increased dramatically over time, this early lag is not unexpected. Many other lags, however, appear dramatically prolonged, and can come to an end with changes to the invader or its environment. For example, exotics can exist in relatively low numbers for decades before exploding, or invaders can become more aggressive over time and increase their impacts on native species. Invasion-related lags are critical for our efforts to manage invaders, as they may lead us to make inaccurate assessments of the risks posed by invaders as well as miss critical windows for action. Recognition of the phenomenon of long lags before sudden changes in invader dynamics also suggests that we adopt a strict precautionary principle: we should assume that any invader has the potential for undesirable effects and that long periods of seemingly consistent behaviour can be poor predictors of what invaders will do in the future.},

abstract = {Interest in use of bivalves to remediate estuarine eutrophication has increased in recent years. High variation among data sets, substantial focus on particle removal, and insufficient links to anthropogenic nitrogen (N) sources encouraged this empirical examination of N removal by bivalves from estuaries receiving different N loads. We determined the capacity of the oyster Crassostrea virginica to remove N by comparing N assimilated into tissues with anthropogenic N from land or available in phytoplankton. Oyster growth yielded 0.2-0.4 g N in tissues and depended on estuary-specific conditions. delta N-15 values confirmed that N in oyster tissues derived from local anthropogenic sources. At representative restoration and aquaculture conditions ({\textless}= 400 oysters.m(-2) at 0.5{\%}-1.0{\%} of estuary area), estimated N removal was {\textless}= 15{\%} of land-derived loads and {\textless}1{\%} of phytoplankton N. N removal via biogeochemical processes was negligible during grow-out, but became important after oysters attained harvestable size. This study explicitly demonstrates that oysters assimilated land-derived N, but suggests that bivalve bioremediation consider trade-offs between intensity of planting, ecological effects, and available space.},

abstract = {The fact that land-derived sources of nutrients promote eutrophication in the receiving coastal waters implies coupling between land and marine environments. Increasing nitrogen inputs in the estuaries are followed by major shifts in biota composition and abundances. In the present paper we used N and C isotopic ratios to analyze the coupling of benthic and pelagic components of food webs to estuaries receiving different N loads from their watersheds. We found that primary producers, benthic taxa, and fishes were coupled to the watersheds and estuaries where they were collected. In contrast, zooplankton was uncoupled. Primary consumers and predators feeding on benthic prey within the estuaries were also coupled to the watershed and estuaries, but predators feeding on zooplankton were not. We hypothesized that short water residence time in these estuaries uncoupled plankton from terrestrial influence. Stable isotopic measurements of N in producers, consumers, POM, and sediment in different estuaries of Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, USA, demonstrate a consistent link between land-use on contributing watersheds and the isotopic ratio in all the benthic components and food webs. The remarkably consistent link suggests that the benthos was tightly coupled to land-derived inputs, and that these components, particularly macrophytes, could be good indicators for monitoring increases in land-derived N inputs. Our results showed that stable isotopes of N and C have the potential for use in basic research and applied monitoring, but need to be applied considering the features of estuaries that might couple or uncouple organisms regarding dependency on land, such as hydrodynamic exchanges. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2006.},

Relatively little is known about particle selection by O. edulis, and the goal of the present study was to establish baselines for particle selection by both oyster species under controlled conditions in the laboratory. The study was carried out with adult oysters of similar shell size collected in the Limfjord estuary, Denmark (5647N, 0851E), in November 2011. The feeding traits of both species [clearance rate (CR), retention efficiency (RE) and lower threshold for clearance (LTC)] were compared using five algal species with different cell sizes (5−32 m ESD) (Isochrysis galbana, Rhodomonas salina, Thalassiosira weissflogii, Prorocentrum micans and Akashiwo sanguinea). Oysters were acclimated to an experimental temperature of 22 C and a salinity of 25. The CR of O. edulis was one to three times lower than that of C. gigas for the three smaller algal species (5−15 m) but not different for the two larger algae. Algae in the size range 7−32 m were retained with 100{\%} RE by both oysters, but the smallest alga was retained with reduced RE (35{\%}). There were no differences in LTC between the two oysters. A closer examination of the relationship between LTC and different measures of the algae present (cell size, cell volume, chl a, C and N) suggests that the LTC, and also the CR, may depend in part on the internal energy status of the oysters.},

abstract = {Changes in geomorphology of estuaries are common following major perpetuations such as hurricanes and may have profound impacts on biological systems. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 created a new pass, called Katrina Cut, halving Dauphin Island in Mobile Bay, Alabama. Significant decline in oyster population at Cedar Point Reef, the primary oyster harvest grounds in Mobile Bay, had persisted since then until the Cut was artificially closed in 2010. A bio-physical model for hydrodynamics and oyster larval transport was used to evaluate two potential mechanisms responsible for oyster population declines: salinity changes in the context of oyster habitat suitability and retention of oyster larvae. The model results revealed that when open Katrina Cut increased salinity at Cedar Point Reef. During high freshwater discharge, in particular, water exchange through Katrina Cut increased the bottom salinity from {\textless}5 psu to well over 15 (sometimes {\textgreater}20) psu during the tropic tides. Elevated salinities are associated with greater predation on oysters and higher disease incidence. The presence of the Katrina Cut also reduced larval retention in the spawning area regardless of tidal or river discharge conditions. We conclude that closing the Cut likely improved conditions for oysters within Mobile Bay and eastern Mississippi Sound and that these improved conditions have contributed to increased oyster landings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Uni-Pore polycarbonate membranes with pore sizes of 0.4, 1 and 5 pm diameter were used as standard 'sieve' fllters, since they have well-defined pore sizes. Using means of the differences of paired filters, it was found that GF/C glass-fiber filters retain seston from North Sea samples as efficiently as 0.4 pm Uni-Pore filters at a seston concentration range of about 1.5 to 15 mg dm-3; this covers most of the German Bight water bodies in summer. Glass-fiber filters retained significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) more seston than 1 pm Uni-Pore filters and thus more as their nominal mean retention size of 1.2 p would suggest. Comparison of seston retention of GF/C and Uni-Pore filters by regression analysis revealed that GF/C filters tend to retain relatively more seston as the water becomes clearer and sample volumes greater; this is the case in the western German Bight (Secchi depth about 7 to 9 m, seston concentrations {\textless} 2 mg dm-3, sample volumes filtered: 600 to 1000 cm3). This higher retention of GF/C filters is significant (P = 0.05) when compared with 0.4 pm Uni-Pore filters but highly significant (P {\textless} 0.001) with 1 pm Uni-Pore filters. This indicates that particles {\textless} 1 pm contributes significantly to the seston weight in such open North Sea water It seemed unlikely. however, that adsorbed dissolved organic matter caused a 'seston' weight increase.},

abstract = {Interactions between predators and their prey are influenced by the habitat they occupy. Using created oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reef mesocosms, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments that created structure and manipulated complexity as well as prey density and "predator-free space" to examine the relationship between structural complexity and prey survivorship. Specifically, volume and spatial arrangement of oysters as well as prey density were manipulated, and the survivorship of prey (grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio) in the presence of a predator (wild red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus) was quantified. We found that the presence of structure increased prey survivorship, and that increasing complexity of this structure further increased survivorship, but only to a point. This agrees with the theory that structural complexity may influence predator-prey dynamics, but that a threshold exists with diminishing returns. These results held true even when prey density was scaled to structural complexity, or the amount of "predator-free space" was manipulated within our created reef mesocosms. The presence of structure and its complexity (oyster shell volume) were more important in facilitating prey survivorship than perceived refugia or density-dependent prey effects. A more accurate indicator of refugia might require "predator-free space" measures that also account for the available area within the structure itself (i.e., volume) and not just on the surface of a structure. Creating experiments that better mimic natural conditions and test a wider range of "predator-free space" are suggested to better understand the role of structural complexity in oyster reefs and other complex habitats. {\textcopyright} 2011 This is an open-access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

We emphasize throughout the importance of understanding how adaptive, quantitative genetic variation is distributed within and among populations and the limitations of studies that address only selectively neutral molecular genetic variation. We also describe a conceptual framework for making genetically sound management and restoration decisions based on historical and current ecological and genetic considerations.

abstract = {Despite the widely acknowledged threat posed by invasive species in coastal estuaries, there are substantial gaps at the intersection of science and policy that are impeding invasive species management. In the face of pressing management needs in coastal and estuarine environments, we advocate that introduced species should receive the kind of management effort dedicated, for example, to reducing pollution. We support our argument with some examples of economic costs of estuarine and coastal introduced species and a summary of recent evidence for the ecological costs. We highlight some of the issues that either thwart or facilitate the successful marriage between science and management of introduced species, including the regulatory framework for management. We use the available information on coastal eradication programs, including case histories of the programs for Caulerpa taxifolia and Spartina alterniflora (and hybrids) in the western USA, to indicate the feasibility of managing introduced species and to help point out how management and science can improve the outcome. We close with a research agenda that focuses primarily on science that will really assist with invasive species management and reflects our own experience and the opinions of managers directly involved with this issue. {\textcopyright} 2007 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.},

abstract = {Understanding why a species occupies a certain geographic range and predicting how they will be affected by climate change require characterizing physiological traits in geographically-distant populations. The objective of this study was to perform a direct comparison of two eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) populations that occupy contrasting temperature and salinity habitats, New Brunswick, Canada (47°N – Gulf of St. Lawrence) and Louisiana, USA (29°N – Gulf of Mexico). Specifically, clearance rate, valve opening, and oxygen consumption rate were measured in oysters of both populations following a full factorial design with three temperatures (10, 20, 30 °C) and two salinities (15, 25). New Brunswick oysters had a greater gill area, shell gape angle, and oxygen consumption rate. Temperature was the main driver of clearance rate, valve opening duration and oxygen consumption rate. Clearance rate at 20 °C and 30 °C was significantly higher than at 10 °C, and oysters at 20 °C had their valves opened for a greater percentage of time compared to oysters at 10 °C and 30 °C. Oxygen consumption rate increased gradually from 10 °C to 30 °C and similarly for both populations, with no indications of a thermal breakpoint at 30 °C. Temperature coefficients for the oxygen consumption rate (Q10) were within the normal ecological range for both populations. No physiological differences were observed between salinity treatments in both populations. No latitudinal compensation in the physiological rates was found. Overall, results showed that C. virginica is tolerant to a broad range of temperatures and salinities. Such physiological plasticity is consistent with the species' extended geographical range.},

abstract = {Macroplastic debris recorded in the Mariana Trench and accumulated on some deep-sea canyons worldwide has aroused great public concerns. Large plastic debris dumps found in canyons of the Xisha Trough, South China Sea have become hot spots for deep-sea pollution, with 1 order of magnitude higher abundance than in other investigated canyons. Here we adopted an integrative specimen-based approach to examine macroplastic items from large debris dumps in the Xisha Trough and comparative items from continental shelves with rare macroplastics. On the investigated items, we found an epibenthic ecosystem with relatively high species diversity, comprised of 49 mm-sized fungi and invertebrate species dominated by scyphozoan polyps and brachiopod juveniles according to inhabiting density. These large dumps are functioning as new biodiversity hot spots hosting endemic species like soft corals or aplacophoran molluscs, providing a spawning habitat for gastropods and even specialized parasitic flatworms, and can be inferred as potential scattered regional sources releasing deep-sea coronate jellyfish. We hypothesize that macroplastics can boost population extension of sessile and some free-living (Mollusca) invertebrates and affect the deep-sea benthic-pelagic coupling process. The baseline of associated organisms needs to be set up and monitored in more canyons, where debris is transported to and accumulated at the highest density.},

abstract = {Biodiversity is considered to be an essential element of the Earth system, driving important ecosystem services. However, the conservation of biodiversity in a quickly changing world is a challenging task which requires costefficient and precise monitoring systems. In the present study, the suitability of airborne discrete-return LiDAR data for the mapping of vascular plant species richness within a Sub-Mediterranean second growth native forest ecosystemwas examined. The vascular plant richness of four different layers (total, tree, shrub and herb richness) was modeled using twelve LiDAR-derived variables. As species richness values are typically count data, the corresponding asymmetry and heteroscedasticity in the error distribution has to be considered. In this context, we compared the suitability of random forest (RF) and a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a negative binomial error distribution. Both models were coupled with a feature selection approach to identify the most relevant LiDAR predictors and keep the models parsimonious. The results of RF and GLM agreed that the three most important predictors for all four layers were altitude above sea level, standard deviation of slope and mean canopy height. This was consistent with the preconception of LiDAR's suitability for estimating species richness,which is its capacity to capture three types of information: micro-topographical, macro-topographical and canopy structural. Generalized Linear Models showed higher performances (r2: 0.66, 0.50, 0.52, 0.50; nRMSE: 16.29{\%}, 19.08{\%}, 17.89{\%}, 21.31{\%} for total, tree, shrub and herb richness respectively) than RF (r2: 0.55, 0.33, 0.45, 0.46; nRMSE: 18.30{\%}, 21.90{\%}, 18.95{\%}, 21.00{\%} for total, tree, shrub and herb richness, respectively). Furthermore, the results of the best GLMwere more parsimonious (three predictors) and less biased than the best RFmodels (twelve predictors). We think that this is due to the mentioned non-symmetric error distribution of the species richness values, which RF is unable to properly capture. Froman ecological perspective, the predicted patterns agreedwell with the known vegetation composition of the area. We found especially high species numbers at low elevations and along riversides. In these areas, overlapping distributions of thermopile sclerophyllos species,water demanding Valdivian evergreen species and species growing in Nothofagus obliqua forests occur. The three main conclusions of the study are: 1) appropriatemodel selection is crucialwhenworkingwith biodiversity count data; 2) the application of RF for datawith non-symmetric error distributions is questionable; and 3) structural and topographic information derived from LiDAR data is useful for predicting local plant species richness.},

abstract = {Although invasion risk is expected to increase with propagule pressure (PP), it is unclear whether PP-invasibility relationships follow an asymptotic or some other non-linear form and whether such relationships vary with underlying environmental conditions. Using manipulations of PP, soil fertility and disturbance, we tested how each influence PP-invasibility relationships for Lespedeza cuneata in a Kansas grassland and use recruitment curve models to determine how safe sites may contribute to plant invasions. After three growing seasons, we found that the PP-invasibility relationships best fit an asymptotic model of invasion reflecting a combination of density-independent and density-dependent processes and that seeds were aggregated within the plant community despite efforts to uniformly sow seeds. Consistent with some models, community invasibility decreased with enhanced soil fertility or reduced levels of disturbance in response to changes in the fraction of safe sites. Our results illustrate that disturbance and soil fertility can be a useful organizing principle for predicting community invasibility, asymptotic models are a reasonable starting point for modeling invasion, and new modeling techniques-coupled with classic experimental approaches-can enhance our understanding of the invasion process. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The impacts of natural mussel assemblages on near-bed hydrodynamics, sediment erosion and deposition were quantified in flume studies. Mussels were sampled from a site in the Menai Strait (North Wales), together with field measurements of hydrodynamics over the tidal cycle (water depth, current speeds, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)). Bare sediment (within a mussel bed but 1.5 m from mussels) was very stable due to the influence of microphytobenthos (critical erosion velocity (Ucrit) = 0.49 m s- 1; critical bed shear stress (??e) = 0.4 Pa). Sediment associated with 55{\%} and 95{\%} mussel coverage was more easily eroded (Ucrit = 0.18 and 0.21 m s- 1). This was primarily due to the mussels enhancing near-bed TKE, and thus bed shear stress (??0), which resulted in ??e values (0.5 and 0.7 Pa, respectively), slightly higher than the bare sediment (0{\%} cover). Consequently, mussel assemblages induced resuspension of sediment and microphytobenthos at significantly lower current speeds, within the range recorded in the field. Flume simulated sinusoidal current cycles confirmed the influence of mussels on erosion thresholds for microphytobenthos and sediment with accelerating currents. Mussel suspension feeding activity enhanced the rapid clearance of particles from the water column (deposition) after the onset of decelerating currents. The results support the hypothesis that self-organised structures (mussel strings) enhance near-bed turbulence and the resuspension of microphytobenthos under moderate flows conditions ({\textless} 0.3 m s- 1). Thus self-organised mussel beds enhance the provision of food through resuspension that serves to offset the depletion of phytoplankton in the water column immediately above mussel beds. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Comparative genomic analyses can provide valuable insight into functional evolutionary divergence among closely related species. Here we employ a comparative evolutionary analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from two closely related species of marine fishes (genus Sebastes - rockfish). Sebastes is a highly diverse group of marine fishes that inhabit a wide array of marine habitats and the study of this group can provide insights into speciation in the marine environment. ESTs were developed for S. caurinus (23,668 from brain, kidney, and spleen tissues) and S. rastrelliger (11,207 from brain and pituitary tissues). Following assembly we were able to identify, with high confidence, 257 orthologous sequence pairs between the two species through a reciprocal best hit blast search. An analysis of functional divergence between orthologs revealed that 19.46{\%} had Ka/Ks values greater than 0.5 and 8.17{\%} had Ka/Ks values greater than one, identifying a large pool of candidate genes to further study adaptive divergence in the group. Genes with elevated Ka/Ks values belonged to the following functional categories: immune function, metabolism, longevity, and reproductive behavior, indicating that adaptive divergence in these functional groups may be important in the diversification of this group of fishes. This study provides the ground work to better understand the molecular evolution of genes involved in a radiation of marine fishes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Oyster shell is a crucial component of healthy oyster reefs. Shell planting has been a main component of oyster restoration efforts in many habitats and has been carried out on scales from individual and grassroots efforts to multiagency efforts across entire estuaries. However, the cycling and lifetime of the shell that makes up the bulk of an oyster reef has only recently received attention, and most of the work to date has focused on the role of epi-and endobionts on shell degradation. Here we report findings from a laboratory study in which we manipulated pH in a flow-through control system using water from the mesohaline mouth of the Patuxent River to measure dissolution rates of intact oyster shell. Shells from the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin 1791) with three different legacies were exposed to 4 levels of pH that encompass a range typical of the mesohaline waters of the Chesapeake Bay (∼7.27.9 on the NBS scale). Mass loss over a 2-wk period was used to measure dissolution rate on 3 shell legacies: fresh, weathered, and dredged. We found that pH and shell legacy had significant effects on shell dissolution rate, with lower pH increasing dissolution rate. Fresh shell had the highest dissolution rate, followed by weathered then dredged shell. Dissolution rates were significantly different among all 4 pH treatments, except between the lowest (∼7.2) and the next lowest (∼7.4); however, shells lost mass even under noncorrosive conditions (∼7.9). We discuss the implications of our findings to ongoing efforts to understand shell budgets and cycling in oyster reef habitat, the interaction of biological and geochemical agents of shell degradation, and the complexity associated with shell carbonate cycling in the unique milieu of the oyster reef.},

abstract = {There is growing concern about a possible link between global climate change and the spread of infectious diseases. Previous reports suggest that coastal water quality - and by implication human health risk - are influenced by global climate variability. However, relatively little is known, either qualitatively or quantitatively, about how coastal water quality is impacted by the combined influence of local-scale changes (e.g., land-use changes) and global climate variability. To fill this knowledge gap, we compiled and analyzed a 32 yearlong time series of water quality measurements (n∼68,304) in Newport Bay, a regionally important embayment in southern California. To identify dominant spatial and temporal trends in the time series, we utilized a mathematical technique widely employed in the atmospheric and ocean sciences - called Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. The results show that 69{\%} of the temporal water quality variability is associated with rainfall, implying that a very large fraction of the water quality signal can be attributed to storm water runoff. Moreover, trend analysis on the time series demonstrate that water quality, particularly during winter storms, is influenced by long-period processes that generate more local rainfall, including El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO) events. Indeed, we demonstrate that the water quality signal measured in Newport Bay can be reproduced by a simple box model that takes, as input, daily estimates for the load of fecal pollution flowing into the Bay from the watershed, solar radiation, and tidal mixing residence times. Analytical and modeling tools developed for this study should be readily generalizable to other field sites. The results presented here should be useful for both policy makers interested in developing Fecal Coliform TMDLs for the Bay, and scientists interested in understanding how climate changes influence the spread of infectious diseases. {\textcopyright} copyright ASCE 2005.},

abstract = {Most ecosystems are subject to both natural and human disturbances that can combine to influence populations and assemblages in complex ways. Assessing the relative influences and combined impacts of natural and human disturbance is crucial for managing human uses of ecosystems against the backdrop of their natural variability. We evaluated the separate and combined influences of disturbance from storm waves and disturbance associated with human trampling of rocky shores by conducting an experiment mimicking controlled levels of trampling at sites with different wave exposures, and before and after a major storm event in central California, USA. Results show that trampling and storm waves affected the same taxa and have comparable and additive effects on rocky shore assemblages. Both disturbance types caused significant reduction in percent cover of mussels and erect macroalgae, and resulted in significant re-organization of assemblages associated with these habitat-forming taxa. A single extreme storm event caused similar percent cover losses of mussels and erect macroalgae as did 6-12 months of trampling. Contrary to a predicted synergistic effect of trampling and storm damage, we found that impacts from each disturbance combined additively. Mussel beds in wave-exposed sites are more vulnerable to trampling impacts than algal beds at protected sites. Mussels and erect macroalgae recovered within five years after trampling stopped. These results suggest that impacts from local human use can be reversed in relatively short time frames, and that cumulative impacts can be reduced by setting recreational carrying capacities more conservatively when ecosystems are already exposed to frequent and/or intense natural disturbances.},

abstract = {Turbulent mixing is an integral aspect of aquatic ecosystems. Turbulence affects ecosystem features ranging from phytoplankton blooms at large scales through microscale interactions in the plankton. Enclosed experimental ecosystems, if they are to mimic the function of natural ecosystems, also must mimic natural turbulence and its effects. Large-scale velocity gradients and unstable buoyancy fluxes generate turbulent mixing in nature, most often at the surface and bottom boundaries and in the pycnocline. Large eddy sizes are controlled by the mixed layer depth, boundary layer thickness, or overturning length in the pycnocline. Turbulent energy cascades through smaller and smaller eddy scales until it can be dissipated by molecular viscosity at the smallest scales. In contrast, artificial apparatuses frequently are used to generate turbulent mixing in the interior of experimental ecosystem enclosures. Large eddy sizes are controlled by the size of the generation apparatus, and they usually are much smaller than in nature. Mismatched large eddy length scales and differences in turbulence generation mechanisms are responsible for the difficulties in mimicking natural turbulent mixing in experimental enclosures. The 2 most important turbulence parameters to consider in experimental ecosystem research are overall mixing time, Tm, and turbulence dissipation rate, e. If the levels, spatial distributions, and temporal variabiity of Tm and e can be matched between an enclosure and the natural systems it is to model, then potential mixing artifacts can be minimized. An important additional consideration is that benthic ecosystems depend on the time-averaged boundary layer flow as much as the turbulence. Existing designs for mixing experimental ecosystems are capable of reasonably representing some aspects of natural turbulent mixing. Paddle and grid stirring are the best available techniques for water column mixing, and flumes are best for benthic turbulence. There is no design at present that represents both environments adequately. More work also is needed on mixing of flexible-wall in situ enclosures. A more serious problem, however, is that turbulent mixing in experimental ecosystem studies too often is ignored, inadequately characterized, or unreported. Several methods are available for reasonable characterization of mixing in enclosures without sophisticated technology, and the technology for direct velocity measurements is becoming more accessible. Experimental ecosystem researchers should make a concerted effort toimplement, characterize, and report on turbulent mixing in their enclosures.},

However, the techniques used contain inherent problems, particularly with regards to the generation of authentic and useful data. The solution currently advocated to reduce contamination and artefactual results is to adopt criteria for authentication. Nevertheless, these criteria are not foolproof, and we believe that they have, in practice, replaced the use of thought and prudence when designing and executing ancient DNA studies. We argue here that researchers in this field must take a more cognitive and self-critical approach. Specifically, in place of checking criteria off lists, researchers must explain, in sufficient enough detail to dispel doubt, how the data were obtained, and why they should be believed to be authentic. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Habitat restoration encompasses a broad range of activities, emphasizing very different issues, goals, and approaches depending on the operational definition of 'restoration'. This is particularly true for many shellfish (molluscan) dominated systems (e.g. oyster reefs, mussel beds, vermetid gastropod reefs). In contrast to other well-studied biogenic habitats, such as seagrasses, mangroves, or salt marshes, bivalves are directly consumed as a resource. Hence resource extraction has direct consequences for habitat health. Restoration objectives have typically included reduction of public health risks through improved water quality to increase harvest. Restoration or enhancement of populations of commercially exploited shellfish depressed by overharvesting and/or reduced environmental quality remains the principal motivation behind most shellfish 'restoration' efforts. Direct and indirect ecosystem services (e.g. filtering capacity, benthic - pelagic coupling, nutrient dynamics, sediment stabilization, provision of habitat, etc.) derived from oyster habitat have been largely ignored or underestimated. Only recently, the restoration of lost ecological function associated with shellfish communities has been included in our discussions and related research examining habitat development and function through a scientific approach. The former area has been reviewed extensively and will not be our focus here. In this review, we examine some of the restoration efforts made in the name of fisheries enhancement, address their effectiveness, and discuss some of the issues associated with realizing the broader goal of ecological restoration. We note the importance of linking success criteria to specific goals and make the case for a greater need in clarifying the ecological functions of shellfish and shellfish habitats. We recognize the limitations of existing datasets and summarize ongoing attempts to address oyster habitat restoration throughout the broad geographic distribution of the American oyster. Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin). In many ways this topic parallels the ongoing debate over 'attraction versus production' associated with artificial reef management. We consider how local conditions (e.g. tidal range, bottom topography, turbidity, salinity) and resulting habitat traits affect restoration strategies. We also discuss the underappreciated value of shellfish populations from those areas designated as closed to harvesting due to their intrinsic worth as habitat/larval reserves. The necessity of ecosystem (adaptive) management strategies emerges from this discussion. Finally, this overview supports our contention that shellfish habitat should be included in discussions of essential fish habitats' (or EFH). (C) Elsevier Science B.V.},

Unfortunately, to date, the study of invasions has been primarily anecdotal and resistant to generalization. 2. Here, we use insights from experiments and long-term monitoring studies of vegetation to propose a new theory in which fluctuation in resource availability is identified as the key factor controlling invasibility, the susceptibility of an environment to invasion by non-resident species. The theory is mechanistic and quantitive in nature leading to a variety of testable predictions. 3. We conclude that the elusive nature of the invasion process arises from the fact that it depends upon conditions of resource enrichment or release that must have a variety of causes but occur only intermittently and, to result in invasion, must coincide with availability of invading propagules.},

abstract = {Aposematism is the association, in a prey organism, of the presence of a warning signal with unprofitability to predators. The origin of aposematism is puzzling, because of its predicted low probability of establishment in a population due to the prey's increased conspicuousness. Aposematism is a widespread trait in invertebrate taxa, but, in vertebrates, it is mostly evident in amphibians, reptiles, and fishes. Poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) are one of the most well known examples of the co-occurrence of warning coloration and toxicity. This monophyletic group of mostly diurnal leaf-litter Neotropical anurans has both toxic/colorful and palatable/cryptic species. Previous studies suggested a single origin of toxicity and warning coloration, dividing the family in two discrete groups of primitively cryptic and more derived aposematic frogs. Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses using mostly aposematic taxa supported this conclusion and proposed a single tandem origin of toxicity and conspicuous warning coloration. By using expanded taxon and character sampling, we reexamined the phylogenetic correlation between the origins of toxicity and warning coloration. At least four or five independent origins of aposematism have occurred within poison frogs; by using simulations, we rejected hypotheses of one, two, or three origins of aposematism (P {\textless} 0.002). We also found that diet specialization is linked with the evolution of aposematism. Specialization on prey, such as ants and termites, may have evolved independently at least two times.},

abstract = {Retention efficiencies (RE) of scallop (Chlamys farreri), oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and mussel (Mytilus edulis) in a flow-through system were measured to understand the short-term response to various particle and organic matter concentrations. By comparing the RE of C. farreri with that of C. gigas and M. edulis, we gained further knowledge on the feeding physiological characteristics of C. farreri and ascertained the possible cause of high summer mortalities of this species. The experimental feeding conditions included natural differences in the abundance and composition of suspended seston, as well as conditions in which seston abundance and composition were manipulated by adding natural silt or cultured microalgae. The results show that in natural sea water, the minimum particle size for maximal retention in M. edulis, C. gigas and C. farreri was approximately 4, 6, and 8 mu m, respectively; the RE of 2-mu m (equivalent spherical diameter) particles was 17{\%}, 19{\%}, and 8{\%}, respectively; and the relative standardized RE was 58{\%}, 49{\%}, and 18{\%}, respectively. In C. gigas and M. edulis, the minimal particle size for maximal retention did not change with food quality (organic content). C. farreri was more sensitive to fluctuations in particle concentration and organic content. With particle concentration increase, the minimal particle size for maximal retention in scallop shifted to large particles and the RE for 2-mu m particle decreased from 8{\%} in natural seawater to 1.6{\%}-6{\%} in silt-enriched groups. With organic content increase, the minimal particle size for maximal retention shifted from 8 to 5 mu m in natural seawater. Variation in RE of C. farreri with food conditions and the relationship between lower RE and smaller particle size may hamper C. farreri from food taking due to the decrease in the size distribution of phytoplankton in Sungo Bay.},

abstract = {Multiple stressors in estuaries can cause declines in native species and impairment of ecosystem goods and services. In contrast, one stressor-the introduction of non-native species-actually leads to higher local richness. We examined the changes in ecosystem function associated with introductions into Willapa Bay, Washington, USA, a relatively undeveloped estuary with 45 documented exotic marine species. The replacement of native oysters by 2 new bivalve species has increased secondary production of harvested suspension feeders by 250 {\%} over peak historic values (3.3 x 10(5) vs. 0.9 x 10(5) kg dry wt yr(-1)), based on {\textgreater} 150 yr of records of harvested biomass. Key aspects of aquaculture-particularly planted area-have remained constant over time, so we attribute much of the altered secondary production to higher growth rates of non-native species. The addition of 2 tracheophytes has increased primary production on the tideflats by {\textgreater} 50{\%}, (5.3 x 10(7) vs. 3.5 x 10(7) kg dry wt yr(-1)), which we calculated by scaling up local measurements of plant growth to the total area occupied by each species. These changes in production are also associated with altered detritus, water filtration, and biogenic habitat. Because other stressors are largely absent from Willapa Bay, the addition of particular exotic species has dramatically enhanced system production, while fundamentally reshaping the ecological character of the estuary. These strong ecological impacts of introduced species have rarely been measured at whole-ecosystem scales, and they occur in part because new species occupy habitats where similar native species were not present.},

abstract = {It is not known how environmental pressures and sexual selection interact to influence the evolution of extravagant male traits. Sexual and natural selection are often viewed as antagonistic forces shaping the evolution of visual signals, where conspicuousness is favored by sexual selection and crypsis is favored by natural selection. Although typically investigated independently, the interaction between natural and sexual selection remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate whether sexual dichromatism evolves stochastically, independent from, or in concert with habitat use in darters, a species-rich lineage of North American freshwater fish. We find the evolution of sexual dichromatism is coupled to habitat use in darter species. Comparative analyses reveal that mid-water darter lineages exhibit a narrow distribution of dichromatism trait space surrounding a low optimum, suggesting a constraint imposed on the evolution of dichromatism, potentially through predator-mediated selection. Alternatively, the transition to benthic habitats coincides with greater variability in the levels of dichromatism that surround a higher optimum, likely due to relaxation of the predator-mediated selection and heterogeneous microhabitat dependent selection regimes. These results suggest a complex interaction of sexual selection with potentially two mechanisms of natural selection, predation and sensory drive, that influence the evolution of diverse male nuptial coloration in darters.},

abstract = {The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) was introduced into Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland in the 1970s. It was assumed that local environmental conditions would not facilitate successful reproduction. However, in the 1990s there were reports of C. gigas outside licensed aquaculture sites and this investigation set out to ascertain the current distribution, years of likely recruitment and population structure of the species. C. gigas were found distributed widely throughout the northern basin during surveys; the frequency distribution suggesting C. gigas is not recruiting every year. Establishment of feral populations of C. gigas elsewhere have linked to habitat change. A pilot cull was initiated to assess the success rate of early intervention. This paper demonstrates the potential benefits of responding rapidly to initial reports of non-native species in a way that may curtail establishment and expansion. The method advocated in simple and can be recommended to the appropriate regulatory authorities.},

For the near bottom (1 cm height) samples, chlorophyll a concentrations and variations were greater in a seagrass bed than those measured in the adjoining bare sand habitat. Samples collected at 5, 15, and 45 cm above the bottom did not exhibit any habitat-specific pattern. Up to 90{\%} of the near-bottom microalgal count in the seagrass bed was pennate diatoms suggesting that much of the chlorophyll a is derived from the bed. Current speeds measured just above the bottom in the seagrass bed were considerably lower ({\textless}1 cm s-1) than elsewhere. Results suggest a relatively concentrated, locally-generated near-bottom food resource for hard clam within the vegetated habitat. Resource depletion (suspension feeders reducing the food level for others downstream) may not be relevant to hard clam populations at this site. -from Authors},

Here, we describe the molecular changes underlying adaptive coat color variation in a natural population of rock pocket mice, Chaetodipus intermedius. Rock pocket mice are generally light-colored and live on light-colored rocks. However, populations of dark (melanic) mice are found on dark lava, and this concealing coloration provides protection from avian and mammalian predators. We conducted association studies by using markers in candidate pigmentation genes and discovered four mutations in the melanocortin-1-receptor gene, Mc1r, that seem to be responsible for adaptive melanism in one population of lava-dwelling pocket mice. Interestingly, another melanic population of these mice on a different lava flow shows no association with Mc1r mutations, indicating that adaptive dark color has evolved independently in this species through changes at different genes.},

The impact of this service on another species of restoration concern, eelgrass Zostera marina, is unclear, but it is hypothesized to be positive if oyster filter feeding increases light penetration to eelgrass. For two years after construction of an oyster restoration project, I assessed the response in an adjacent eelgrass bed (impact) and control eelgrass bed by monitoring changes in light intensity, eelgrass shoot density, biomass, leaf morphodynamics and epiphyte load. Though I observed some minor short-term effects of the constructed oyster bed, in general I did not detect a conspicuous impact on the adjacent eelgrass bed. I found a minor impact on light, which was significantly lower eachday in the impact site than in teh control site for 3 months following construction. I observed leaf morphological variations between the sites as the eelgrass in the control site became denser, with shorter and narrower leaves, while the impact bed maintained a more consistent density and mean leaf size. Declines in below-ground biomass after construction of the oyster bed were observed in the impact site only, but did not translate into above-ground biomass loss. Overall, the changes observed were not outside the wide range of natural variation expected in this system, nor were they detrimental to the adjacent eelgrass bed. These findings support the potential coexistence of a constructed Olympia oyster bed and adjacent eelgrass, which is relevant to the design of future restoration efforts for both species.},

Here, we present, to our knowledge, the first ever large-scale quantitative assessment of the extent and biomass of marine habitat-forming species over a 100-year time frame. We examined records of wild native oyster abundance in the United States from a historic, yet already exploited, baseline between 1878 and 1935 (predominantly 1885-1915), and a current baseline between 1968 and 2010 (predominantly 2000-2010). We quantified the extent of oyster grounds in 39 estuaries historically and 51 estuaries from recent times. Data from 24 estuaries allowed comparison of historic to present extent and biomass. We found evidence for a 64 per cent decline in the spatial extent of oyster habitat and an 88 per cent decline in oyster biomass over time. The difference between these two numbers illustrates that current areal extent measures may be masking significant loss of habitat through degradation.},

abstract = {Synchronized transitions in the polymorph mineralogy of the major reef-building and sediment-producing calcareous marine organisms and abiotic CaCO 3 precipitates (ooids, marine cements) throughout Phanerozoic time are believed to have been caused by tectonically induced variations in the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater (molar Mg/Ca 2Combining double low line aragonite seas", {\textless}2Combining double low line calcite seas). Here, I assess the geological evidence in support of secular variation in seawater Mg/Ca and its effects on marine calcifiers, and review a series of recent experiments that investigate the effects of seawater Mg/Ca (1.0-5.2) on extant representatives of calcifying taxa that have experienced variations in this ionic ratio of seawater throughout the geologic past.-Secular variation in seawater Mg/Ca is supported by synchronized secular variations in (1) the ionic composition of fluid inclusions in primary marine halite, (2) the mineralogies of late stage marine evaporites, abiogenic carbonates, and reef-and sediment-forming marine calcifiers, (3) the Mg/Ca ratios of fossil echinoderms, molluscs, rugose corals, and abiogenic carbonates, (4) global rates of tectonism that drive the exchange of Mg2+ and Ca2+ along zones of ocean crust production, and (5) additional proxies of seawater Mg/Ca including Sr/Mg ratios of abiogenic carbonates, Sr/Ca ratios of biogenic carbonates, and Br concentrations in marine halite.-Laboratory experiments have revealed that aragonite-secreting bryopsidalean algae and scleractinian corals and calcite-secreting coccolithophores exhibit higher rates of calcification and growth in experimental seawaters formulated with seawater Mg/Ca ratios that favor their skeletal mineral. These results support the assertion that seawater Mg/Ca played an important role in determining which hypercalcifying marine organisms were the major reef-builders and sediment-producers throughout Earth history. The observation that primary production increased along with calcification within the bryopsidalean and coccolithophorid algae in mineralogically favorable seawater is consistent with the hypothesis that calcification promotes photosynthesis within some species of these algae through the liberation of CO2.-The experiments also revealed that aragonite-secreting bryopsidalean algae and scleractinian corals, and bacterial biofilms that secrete a mixture of aragonite and high Mg calcite, began secreting an increased proportion of their calcium carbonate as the calcite polymorph in the lower-Mg/Ca experimental seawaters. Furthermore, the Mg/Ca ratio of calcite secreted by the coccolithophores, coralline red algae, reef-dwelling animals (crustacea, urchins, calcareous tube worms), bacterial biofilms, scleractinian corals, and bryopsidalean algae declined with reductions in seawater Mg/Ca. Notably, Mg fractionation in autotrophic organisms was more strongly influenced by changes in seawater Mg/Ca than in heterotrophic organisms, a probable consequence of autotrophic organisms inducing a less controlled mode of calcification simply through the removal of CO 2 via photosynthesis.-These results indicate that biomineralogical control can be partially overridden by ambient seawater Mg/Ca and suggest that modern aragonite-secreting organisms may have secreted a mixture of aragonite and low Mg calcite, and that modern high Mg calcite-secreting organisms probably secreted low Mg calcite, in calcite seas of the past. These effects of seawater Mg/Ca on the polymorph mineralogy and calcite Mg/Ca ratio of calcareous skeletons should be accounted for in thermal-chemical reconstructions of seawater that are based upon skeletal Mg/Ca.-Lastly, by identifying how marine calcifiers respond to changes in seawater Mg/Ca and absolute Ca2+ concentration, this work should enhance our interpretation of parallel studies investigating the effects of anthropogenic CO 2-induced ocean acidification on marine calcification. {\textcopyright} 2010 Author(s).},

abstract = {Open ocean observations have shown that increasing levels of anthropogenically-derived atmospheric CO2 are causing acidification of the world{\^{a}}s oceans. Yet little is known about coastal acidification and studies are just beginning to characterize the carbonate chemistry of shallow, nearshore zones where many ecologically and economically important organisms occur. We characterized the carbonate chemistry of seawater within an area dominated by seagrass beds (Saint Joseph Bay, Florida), to determine the extent of variation in pH and pCO2 over monthly and daily timescales. Distinct diel and seasonal fluctuations were observed at daily and monthly timescales respectively, indicating the influence of photosynthetic and respiratory processes on the local carbonate chemistry. Over the course of a year, the range in monthly values of pH (7.36 {\^{a}} 8.28), aragonite saturation state (0.65 to 5.63), and calculated pCO2 (195 {\^{a}} 2537 {\^{I}}¼atm) were significant. When sampled on a daily basis the range in pH (7.70 {\^{a}} 8.06), aragonite saturation state (1.86 - 3.85), and calculated pCO2 (379 {\^{a}} 1019 {\^{I}}¼atm) also exhibited significant range and indicated variation between timescales. The results of this study have significant implications for the design of ocean acidification experiments where nearshore species are utilized and indicate that coastal species are experiencing far greater fluctuations in carbonate chemistry than previously thought.},

abstract = {The potential ecotoxicity of fluorescent dyes used in tracing, and their possible effects on human health, were evaluated by reviewing available toxicological information for 12 dyes - fluorescein, Lissamine Flavine FF, Rhodamine WT, Rhodamine B, Sulpho Rhodamine G, Sulpho Rhodamine B, eosin, pyranine, Phorwite BBH Pure, Tinopal 5BM GX, Tinopal CBS-X, and Diphenyl Brilliant Flavine 7GFF - and a dye-intermediate, amino G acid. This evaluation used available toxicological information, test data on analogous substances, and mathematical expressions for biological activity. Based on set criteria for human health and acute ecotoxicity, the evaluation indicated that these tracers have low to moderate levels of concern. The use of these tracers for the study of groundwater flow is appropriate if consideration is given to the overall human health and environmental effects. Their use in the environment requires tracer concentrations not exceeding 1-2 mg 1-1 persisting for a period in excess of 24 h in the groundwater at the point of groundwater withdrawal or discharge. A simple calculated potential dose was used in a comparison of the estimated acute toxicity of Rhodamine WT in rats to the known acute oral toxic dose in humans for several known acutely toxic chemicals. This comparison showed that none of the fluorescent dyes evaluated would present an acutely toxic threat at or substantially above the recommended 2 mg 1-1 concentration. {\textcopyright} 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {The use of simple terms to articulate ecological concepts can confuse ideological debates and undermine management efforts. This problem is particularly acute in studies of nonindigenous species, which alternatively have been called ‘exotic', ‘introduced', ‘invasive' and ‘naturalised', among others. Attempts to redeﬁne commonly used terminology have proven difﬁcult because authors are often partial to particular deﬁnitions. In an attempt to form a consensus on invasion terminology, we synthesize an invasional framework based on current models that break the invasion process into a series of consecutive, obligatory stages. Unlike previous efforts, we propose a neutral terminology based on this framework. This ‘stagebased' terminology can be used to supplement terms with ambiguous meanings (e.g. invasive, introduced, naturalized, weedy, etc.), and thereby improve clarity of future studies. This approach is based on the concept of ‘propagule pressure' and has the additional beneﬁt of identifying factors affecting the success of species at each stage. Under this framework, invasions can be more objectively understood as biogeographical, rather than taxonomic, phenomena; and author preferences in the use of existing terminology can be addressed. An example of this recommended protocol might be: ‘We examined distribution data to contrast the characteristics of invasive species (stages IVa and V) and noninvasive species (stages III and IVb)'.},

abstract = {With an annual production of 1500 metric tons of shucked oysters, Willapa Bay, WA currently produces more oysters than any other estuary in the United States. This production is mainly composed of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), rather than the native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida). Historically, Willapa Bay was home to vast Olympia oyster beds, which formed the foundation of a major extractive fishery in the late 1800s. Yet the historical baseline extent of this habitat is poorly understood as it was first documented following decades of exploitation and was therefore based on a shifted baseline. An extensive and thorough literature review was undertaken to ascertain whether oyster beds mapped as ‘‘cultivated'' in the 1890s were in fact originally wild beds. The most complete harvest statistics to date have been presented for the Olympia oyster in Willapa Bay (from 1849 to 2011) to provide useful historical insights into the expansion and collapse of the Olympia oyster fishery and discuss the evidence for numerous drivers of decline. Compelling evidence found that the historical extent of oyster beds in Willapa Bay may have been as great as 9774 ha, or 27{\%} of the bay bottom, equating to a standing oyster biomass on the order of 3.63106 kg. This figure is significantly greater that the often quoted;2600 ha, derived if only beds marked as natural in the 1880s and 1890s are considered part of the original extent.},

abstract = {The Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida Carpenter 1864,† in estuaries along the Pacific coast of North America, experienced overexploitation throughout its range in the late 1800s, resulting in commercial extinction before 1930. Significant harvest restrictions and marine reserves were established in Washington State by 1897 to protect new recruits, and harvest pressure has been negligible for the past 80 y. Nevertheless, O. lurida remains locally rare. This study focuses on the contemporary dynamics of the remnant population of O. lurida in Willapa Bay, Washington, historicallyhome to the largest native oyster fishery on the coast, with a broad focus on factors preventing recovery. Failed recovery could be because of reproductive limitation, or to poor postrecruitment performance. In this case, reproductive limitation seems unlikely, because historical (1947 to 1983) and modern (2002 to 2006) records reveal 5-fold higher annual spatfall for O. lurida than introduced Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas.) However, O. lurida remains rare and C. gigas is commercially exploited from natural recruitment. To evaluate the effects of abundant C. gigas in intertidal areas on O. lurida settlement patterns, strings of C. gigas shell were placed at two tidal elevations in three habitat types—open mud, eelgrass beds of Zostera marina, and C. gigas reefs. Settlement of O. lurida was significantly higher on the shell strings placed in the C. gigas reefs at both tidal heights. To evaluate postrecruitment demography, juvenile O. lurida were outplanted at three tidal elevations at five sites, and fouling organisms were manipulated to test for competition. Short emersion times (8{\%} greater exposure) reduced survival by 80{\%} relative to subtidal treatments, but did not affect growth rates of survivors. Naturally-setting competitors, mostly nonindigenous, depressed survival by 50{\%} and growth by 20{\%}. In a third experiment, manipulating the density and stability of shell substrate, O. lurida was easily moved or buried when outplanted in a thin, unconsolidated layer. These results indicate that recovery has been hampered by the removal of dense subtidal native oyster shell accumulations during exploitation, by direct competition from exotic species, and by the appearance of novel introduced oyster shell settlement substrate in the intertidal zone. This altered web of interactions influencing O. lurida serves as a model for beginning to explore the failed recovery of overfished species in rapidly changing coastal systems. KEY},

abstract = {The Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida,† is native to the Pacific Coast of North America and was common in Puget Sound prior to the arrival of European settlers. Over harvest in the late 1800s, combined with severe pollution in the first half of the 20th century from pulp mills, drove many Puget Sound beds to near extinction. Olympia oysters can still be found throughout most of their historic range, but current populations are mostly limited to remnant aggregations where habitat characteristics remain favorable. Whereas Olympia oysters are still present in Puget Sound, their numbers do not compare with the expanses of Olympia oysters that supported a thriving oyster industry in the mid-1800s. One reason for rebuilding Olympia oyester populations is to regain the ecosystem benefits associated with larger assemblages. Skagit County Marine Resources Committee, working in cooperation with shellfish industry, tribal, and community partners initiated a project to establish self-sustaining Olympia oyster beds in Fidalgo Bay near Anacortes, WA. Thus, oysters on these beds must survive, grow, spawn, and produce larvae that recruit to the new beds and surrounding areas. Olympia oyster seed on Pacific oyster cultch were planted in Fidalgo Bay during 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006. Survival and growth of planted seed has been excellent at the first enhancement site. With the addition of seed on cultch during four years and augmentation of the enhancement site with five cubic yards of Pacific oyster shell in 2006, a structured oyster bed is gradually emerging. Deployment of temperature sensors in 2006 showed that water temperatures easily reached the minimum temperature for gameteogenesis and spawning. Examples of larval spawning (veligers in the mantle cavity) and natural postlarval recruitment to the enhancement site were documented in 2006. Several new sites within and around Fidalgo Bay are being evaluated for future rebuilding efforts},

abstract = {Reefs and beds formed by oysters such as the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica and the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida Carpenter 1864† were dominant features in many estuaries throughout their native ranges. Many of these estuaries no longer have healthy, productive reefs because of impacts from destructive fishing, sediment accumulation, pollution, and parasites. Once valued primarily as a fishery resource, increasing attention is being focused today on the array of other ecosystem services that oysters and the reefs they form provide in United States coastal bays and estuaries. Since the early 1990s efforts to restore subtidal and intertidal oyster reefs have increased significantly, with particular interest in small-scale community-based projects initiated most often by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). To date, such projects have been undertaken in at least 15 US states, for both species of dominant native oysters along the United States coast. Community-based restoration practitioners have used a broad range of nonmutually exclusive approaches, including: (1) oyster gardening of hatchery-produced oysters; (2) deployment of juvenile to adult shellfish (‘‘broodstock'') within designated areas for stock enhancement; and (3) substrate enhancement using natural or recycled man-made materials loose or in ‘‘bags'' designed to enhance local settlement success. Many of these approaches are inspired by fishery-enhancement efforts of the past, though are implemented with different outcomes in mind (ecological services vs. fishery outcomes). This paper was originally presented at the first West Coast Restoration Workshop in 2006 in San Rafael, California and is intended to summarize potential approaches for small-scale restoration projects, including some emerging methods, and highlight the logistical benefits and limitations of these approaches. Because the majority of the past efforts have been with C. viriginica, we use those examples initially to highlight efforts with the intent of enlightening current west coast United States efforts with Ostrea lurida. We also discuss site-specific characteristics including ‘‘recruitment bottlenecks'' and ‘‘substrate limitation'' as criteria for identifying the most appropriate approaches to use for small-scale restoration projects. Many of the included ‘‘lessons-learned'' from the smaller-scale restoration projects being implemented today can be used to inform not only large-scale estuary wide efforts to restore C. virginica, but also the relatively nascent efforts directed at restoring the United States west coast's native Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. Abstract. A large-scale field experiment was conducted to test whether the physical structure of biogenic reef habitat controls physical conditions (hydrodynamics and hydro-graphics) with subsequent influence on the performance (recruitment, growth, and survival) of a benthic suspension feeder. The experimental system consisted of restored subtidal oyster reefs inhabited by the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To determine whether the size of reefs influences the flow environment and oyster performance, reefs of four heights-tall (2 m), short (1 m), dredged (0.6 m), and low (0.1 m)-were constructed at 3-m water depth in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. To test whether oyster performance varies with water depth and hydrographic conditions, tall and short reefs were also constructed at 6-m water depth. Flow speed, sedimentation, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and the performance of oysters were measured as a function of reef height, position on reef, and water depth over a 10-mo period. Flow speed was found to increase on reefs with reef height and elevation on reefs. Rates of sediment deposition were seasonally highest where flow speed was lowest, at the bases of reefs, and seasonally decreased with increasing water depth. More than 90{\%} of the surface area of low reefs was buried after only 16 mo of exposure in the estuary, indicating that reef height controls habitat quality (and quantity) indirectly through its effect on flow. Short reefs and the bases of tall reefs at 6-m depth were exposed to a total of 26 d of hypoxia/anoxia. No other reef treatment was exposed to {\textgreater}5 d of hypoxia. Physical conditions on experimental reefs had a profound influence on the performance of oysters as the flow environment alone explained 81 {\%} of variability in oyster growth and mortality. Recruitment of oysters over a 2-mo period was slightly higher on the front bases than the crests of reefs, but did not vary with reef height or water depth. After 10 mo, the shell growth and condition index of genetically similar, hatchery-raised oysters were greatest on the crests of tall and short reefs, where flow speed and quality of suspended food material were highest, and sediment deposition was lowest. Growth was greatest overall at the crests of tall reefs located at 6-m water depth where flow speed was high, and the numbers of days exposed to hypoxia/anoxia and variation in salinity were lowest. Total percentage mortality of oysters after 10 mo was greater on low reefs located at 3-m depth than on all other reef types and was greater on the bases than crests of tall, short, and dredged reefs. Predation by crabs and fishes accounted for 4-20{\%} of total oyster mortality and showed no pattern across reef treatments. Results of this experiment indicate (1) that the physical structure and location of biogenic habitat controls local physical variables and (2) that, in turn, physical variables, especially flow speed, have a profound influence on the performance of a resident species. Realization that an ecological function of habitat is to indirectly control local population production through physical-biological coupling should improve our ability to conserve, restore, and manage habitat and associated species diversity. Better ecological engineering of restored oyster reef habitat is likely to improve fishery production and help maintain estuarine biodiversity.},

abstract = {There is growing concern about a possible link between global climate change and the spread of infectious diseases. Previous reports suggest that coastal water quality - and by implication human health risk - are influenced by global climate variability. However, relatively little is known, either qualitatively or quantitatively, about how coastal water quality is impacted by the combined influence of local-scale changes (e.g., land-use changes) and global climate variability. To fill this knowledge gap, we compiled and analyzed a 32 yearlong time series of water quality measurements (n∼68,304) in Newport Bay, a regionally important embayment in southern California. To identify dominant spatial and temporal trends in the time series, we utilized a mathematical technique widely employed in the atmospheric and ocean sciences - called Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. The results show that 69{\%} of the temporal water quality variability is associated with rainfall, implying that a very large fraction of the water quality signal can be attributed to storm water runoff. Moreover, trend analysis on the time series demonstrate that water quality, particularly during winter storms, is influenced by long-period processes that generate more local rainfall, including El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO) events. Indeed, we demonstrate that the water quality signal measured in Newport Bay can be reproduced by a simple box model that takes, as input, daily estimates for the load of fecal pollution flowing into the Bay from the watershed, solar radiation, and tidal mixing residence times. Analytical and modeling tools developed for this study should be readily generalizable to other field sites. The results presented here should be useful for both policy makers interested in developing Fecal Coliform TMDLs for the Bay, and scientists interested in understanding how climate changes influence the spread of infectious diseases. {\textcopyright} copyright ASCE 2005.},

In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, the National Marine Fisheries Service's Northwest Fisheries Science Center and, on a national scale, the National River Restoration Science Synthesis are combining existing national and regional databases, along with the individual project descriptions, to create comprehensive, web-based databases of stream restoration projects.

abstract = {The clearance rates (CR in 1 g-1 h-1) and net absorption efficiencies (AE) of three co-occurring mytilid species were estimated to determine the effects of variation in ambient seston quantity (total particulate matter, TPM, mg 1-1) and quality (particulate organic matter, POM, mg 1-1; percent organic matter, PCOM = POM/TPM) on these physiological functions. CRs estimates were significantly different among the species (Mytilus galloprovincialis {\textgreater} Perna canaliculus = Aulacomya maoriana), but were not correlated with differences in species-dependent mean body size (P canaliculus{\textgreater}M. galloprovincialis{\textgreater}A. maoriana). AE estimates were independent of mean body weight, and did not differ among the species. For all three species, CR responded in a simple linear manner to seston organic content, either in terms of POM (for A. maoriana and M. galloprovincialis), or PCOM (for P canaliculus). The AE response, although also of a simple linear type, was species-dependent and involved interactions of two or three seston components: TPM, POM and PCOM for A. maoriana; POM and PCOM for M. galloprovincialis; and TPM and PCOM for P. canaliculus. For all three species, seston variation explained 15-20{\%} of the variation in CR and 52-59{\%} of the variation in AE. Comparisons among the species indicated that two very different responses to variation in seston quantity and quality exist. First, significant differences in CR result from species dependent differences in the magnitude of the response to seston variation. Second, species-dependent responses to variation in seston variation resulted in the similarity of the AE responses. Thus, the three species appear to have evolved different strategies for dealing with seston variation, but with the end result that their AE responses do not differ. Finally, no evidence was found of a negative association between CR and AE for any of the three species, suggesting that under the seston conditions experienced in this work, these species do not have the physiological compensatory capacity to reduce CR in order to increase AE. The importance of a comparative (i.e., multi-species) approach utilising ambient seston is emphasised by the findings of this research if we are to understand better the feeding and digestive physiologies of suspension-feeding organisms such as mussels. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Foundation species create complex habitats in which associated organisms find refuge from biological and physical stress; these foundation species are thus fundamental to the structure and resilience of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In the present article, we develop an approach to understanding foundation species' effects in communities that are maintained not by a single foundation species, as has been the focus of research to date, but by multiple, co-occurring foundation species. Using examples from diverse ecosystems, we illustrate the prevalence of multiple foundation-species assemblages and hypothesize that the nature of foundation-species interactions has important consequences for community structure. We predict where positive and negative interactions among foundation species will occur and suggest that they organize communities hierarchically in nested or adjacent assemblages that underlie landscape-scale patterns in species distribution. Elucidating the predictable nature of foundation-species interactions may be key to understanding and managing the biodiversity and functioning of many ecosystems.},

abstract = {Oyster culture operations on the West coast of North America have developed into complete farming operations for the introduced Japanese oyster, Crassostrea gigas, which now covers vast areas of the intertidal landscape, particularly in Washington State where the pesticide carbaryl has also been used to control burrowing thalassinid shrimp for more than 30 years. Field experiments were conducted to examine the effects of these habitat modifications on the benthic community in Willapa, Bay Washington (124??06???W, 46??24???N) where 50{\%} of the state's oyster production occurs. Results indicated that the primary long-term effect of carbaryl application was removal of the two species of thalassinid shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis and Upogebia pugettensis), which dominated the community at the start of the experiment and clearly influenced community composition themselves. Small peracarid crustaceans like the amphipods Corophium acherusicum and Eohaustorius estuarius experienced the most significant short-term mortalities, but generally recruited back to treated sites within 3 months, and were often more abundant on treated than untreated sites 1 year after carbaryl application. Results for molluscs were mixed, with no significant effect on Macoma spp, but a significant effect on the commensal clam Crytomya californica and mixed results for the cockle Clinocardium nutalli. Polychaetes were the least susceptible to carbaryl and with the exception of a short-term effect on oligochaetes, no significant negative effects were observed. The addition of oysters did not affect the infaunal community in this study, however greater abundance of epifaunal organisms like mussels, scaleworms, and the amphipod Amphithoe valida, which builds tubes in algae attached to shells, was observed. Carbaryl, which is currently applied to roughly 242 ha ({\textless}6{\%} of the intertidal) in Willapa Bay on an annual basis, has a variable but relatively short-term effect on the benthic community, which should be viewed in the context of other oyster culture operations like the addition of oysters themselves to a community often dominated by burrowing thalassinid shrimp which clearly control its dynamics. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The Grande-Entr{\'{e}}e Lagoon (Magdalen Islands, Canada) has supported mussel (Mytilus edulis) cultivation for the last 25 years. Algal biomass in this lagoon is relatively low while heterotrophic plankton biomass is high. Although often considered herbivorous, it is known that filter-feeding bivalves can consume various types of food, from bacteria to zooplankton. We hypothesize that along with phytoplankton, heterotrophs constitute an important food resource for the Grande-Entr{\'{e}}e mussels. In situ mesocosm experiments were undertaken at different seasons using short socks filled with mussels from the same cohort taken from an aquaculture farm, in order to determine the impact of cultured mussels on local plankton communities and assess the role of heterotrophs. Filtration activity by the mussels and associated epibionts present in the socks was expressed as clearance rates (CR). The average CR over all taxa was lowest in June and highest in October. Diatoms, dinoflagellates and heterotrophic protists constituted the bulk of planktonic carbon removed by mussels. While smaller-sized taxa contributed little ({\textless} 5{\%}) to mussel carbon intake, large-sized heterotrophs (namely ciliates) contributed 69 to 88{\%}. Taxon-marker pigment analyses generally confirmed these observations for groups containing phototrophic pigments. The high heterotrophic biomass retained by mussels indicates they are a major food source for mussels in this environment and should be considered both in the evaluation of mussel feeding and in assessing the influence of cultured mussels on local plankton ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The introduction of non-native species represents unprecedented large-scale experiments that allow us to examine ecological systems in ways that would otherwise not be possible. Invasion by novel ecological types into a community can press a system beyond the bounds normally seen and can reveal community interactions, local drivers and limits within systems that are otherwise hidden by coevolution and a long evolutionary history among local players, as well as local adaptation of species. The success of many invaders is attributed to their ability to thrive in a wide range of habitat types and physical conditions, setting the stage for direct examination of ecological impacts of a species across a range of habitat and community contexts. Bivalves are well-known ecosystem engineers, especially oysters, which are the target of wild-caught fisheries and aquaculture. The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is grown worldwide for aquaculture, and is presently invading shores on virtually every continent. As a consequence, this non-native species is having large impacts on many systems, but the types of impacts are system specific, and greatly depend on substrate type, how physiologically stressful the environment is for intertidal zone species, and the presence of native engineering species. A novel type of engineering effect is identified for this non-native species, whereby it alters not only the physical environment, but also the thermal environment of the community it invades. The impacts of engineering by this non-native species will depend not only on whether it facilitates or inhibits species but also on the trophic level and ecological role of the species affected, and whether similar ecological types are found within the system.},

abstract = {Rivers and streams that dry up are found on every continent, and can form a large proportion of river networks. When rivers are dry, traditional indicators of river health – such as aquatic macroinvertebrates, fish or water quality – cannot be measured. Aquatic health indicators are widely used to assess wetted habitats, but currently no universally applicable indicators have been developed or applied to assess dry riverbed health. Dry riverbeds are often the ‘typical' state of many intermittent rivers and streams; however, the ecological health of these habitats is rarely, if ever, assessed in monitoring programs. Resource managers have called for indicators of intermittent river health during the dry phase. The use of terrestrial invertebrate biota (e.g. ants, beetles, and spiders) as indicators in this study provides a novel solution to assessing rivers when they are dry. We developed a conceptual model of human-induced stressors (i.e. disturbance by livestock and feral mammals) on dry riverbed biota, which guided the selection of potential health indicators. Livestock and feral mammals are one of the most significant stressors on riverine ecosystems in Queensland, and impact riverbeds by altering the substrate through compaction, rooting and pugging. We trialled the use of metrics of terrestrial invertebrate assemblages as indicators of dry riverbed health in four Australian dryland catchments: Bulloo, Paroo, Warrego and Nebine. We used quantile regression and found that terrestrial invertebrate communities responded negatively (and significantly, p {\textless} 0.05) to a gradient of disturbance, defined by on-the-ground field measurements of livestock and feral mammal impacts. This response to stressors was predicted by the initial conceptual model. We conclude that terrestrial invertebrates in this study are suitable indicators of dry riverbed health, as they are impacted by disturbance from livestock and feral mammals. They can be used in the same way that indicators, such as aquatic macroinvertebrates, are traditionally used to assess river health. We also successfully combined indicators of wet and dry habitats to provide a holistic assessment of the health of intermittent river ecosystems incorporating all sections of the river network. We suggest that this approach should be adopted by other river health monitoring programs in rivers around the world.},

abstract = {An important ecological role ascribed to oysters is the transfer of materials from the water column to the benthos as they feed on suspended particles (seston). This ecosystem service has been often touted as a major reason for many oyster restoration efforts, but empirical characterization and quantification of seston removal rates in the field have been lacking. Changes in chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations in the water column were measured in May 2005 and June 2006 in South Carolina using in situ fluorometry and laboratory analysis of pumped water samples taken upstream and downstream as water flowed over natural and constructed intertidal oyster reefs. Both methods gave similar results overall, but with wide variability within individual reef datasets. In situ fluorometer data logged at 10 to 30-s intervals for up to 1.3 h over eight different reefs (three natural and five constructed) showed total removal (or uptake) expressed as {\%} removal of chl a ranging from -9.8{\%} to 27.9{\%}, with a mean of 12.9{\%}. Our data indicate that restored shellfish reefs should provide water-quality improvements soon after construction, and the overall impact is probably determined by the size and density of the resident filter feeder populations relative to water flow characteristics over the reef. The measured population-level chl a removal was converted to mean individual clearance rates to allow comparison with previous laboratory studies. Although direct comparisons could not be made due to the small size of oysters on the study reefs (mean shell height, 36.1 mm), our calculated rates (mean, 1.21 L h -1) were similar to published laboratory measured rates for oysters of this size. However, the wide variability in measured removal by the oyster reefs suggests that individual oyster feeding rates in nature may be much more variable than in the laboratory. The proliferation of ecosystem-level models that simulate the impacts of bivalves on water quality based only on laboratory-feeding measurements underscores the importance of further research aimed at determining ecologically realistic feeding rates for oysters in the field. Because in situ methods provide many replicate measurements quickly, they represent a potentially powerful tool for quantifying the effects of oyster reefs, including all suspension-feeding taxa present, on water quality. {\textcopyright} 2008 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.},

We used a novel before-after-control-impact analysis to test the hypothesis that average body size of intertidal populations of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) inhabiting impacted areas in Louisiana decreased due to increased stress/mortality related to the oil spill. Time-averaged death assemblages of oysters were used to establish a pre-spill baseline of body-size structure for four impacted and four control locations along a 350 km stretch of Louisiana's coastline. Post-spill body sizes were then measured from live oysters at each site in order to evaluate the differences in body size between oiled (i.e. impact) and unoiled (i.e. control) locations before and after the spill. Our results indicate that average body size of oysters remained relatively unchanged after the oil spill. There were also no temporal patterns in temperature, salinity or disease prevalence that could have explained our results. Together, these findings suggest that oysters either recovered rapidly following the immediate impact of the DWH oil spill, or that its impact was not severe enough to influence short-term population dynamics of the oyster beds.},

abstract = {Oyster restoration practitioners augment habitat with hard substrata to increase oyster recruitment, but success can be complicated by non-indigenous species recruitment and physical processes such as sedimentation. From June 2012 to June 2014, we examined changes in shell cover and recruitment of native Ostrea lurida and non-indigenous, global invader Crassostrea gigas onto a constructed oyster bed in Alamitos Bay, CA, USA relative to an un-augmented control mudflat. Due to 72{\%} shell loss after 1 year and informed by a concurrent study on elevational distributions of both oyster species, we augmented the oyster bed with additional shell on the lower-elevation, seaward side. One year later, O. lurida densities were significantly greater on the lower-elevation bed relative to the control and 19.4 times greater than reference populations throughout Alamitos Bay. Crassostrea gigas recruited in densities equivalent to reference populations. Adaptively restoring the bed via shell additions at a lower elevation achieved higher shell retention, increased O. lurida densities, and increased the ratio of native versus non-indigenous oysters. Our increased understanding about the role of tidal elevation in targeted restoration success of a native relative to a non-indigenous oyster species will inform future restoration designs.},

abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO(2) often triggers the production of plant phenolics, including many that serve as herbivore deterrents, digestion reducers, antimicrobials, or ultraviolet sunscreens. Such responses are predicted by popular models of plant defense, especially resource availability models which link carbon availability to phenolic biosynthesis. CO(2) availability is also increasing in the oceans, where anthropogenic emissions cause ocean acidification, decreasing seawater pH and shifting the carbonate system towards further CO(2) enrichment. Such conditions tend to increase seagrass productivity but may also increase rates of grazing on these marine plants. Here we show that high CO(2) / low pH conditions of OA decrease, rather than increase, concentrations of phenolic protective substances in seagrasses and eurysaline marine plants. We observed a loss of simple and polymeric phenolics in the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa near a volcanic CO(2) vent on the Island of Vulcano, Italy, where pH values decreased from 8.1 to 7.3 and pCO(2) concentrations increased ten-fold. We observed similar responses in two estuarine species, Ruppia maritima and Potamogeton perfoliatus, in in situ Free-Ocean-Carbon-Enrichment experiments conducted in tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay, USA. These responses are strikingly different than those exhibited by terrestrial plants. The loss of phenolic substances may explain the higher-than-usual rates of grazing observed near undersea CO(2) vents and suggests that ocean acidification may alter coastal carbon fluxes by affecting rates of decomposition, grazing, and disease. Our observations temper recent predictions that seagrasses would necessarily be "winners" in a high CO(2) world.},

abstract = {Abstract In coastal habitats, mussels are exposed to microplastics (MP; plastic 0.1 ?m?5?mm) and silt, two abiotic particles that are similarly sized and lack nutrition. The addition of MP or silt may change the functional response of mussels. We measured clearance rate (CR) of Mytilus trossulus in three particle treatments (algae, MP?+?algae, and silt?+?algae) across four concentrations to (1) determine if the effects of MP and silt are similar and (2) disentangle the effects of particle type, particle concentration, and proportion of abiotic particles. CR decreased by 62{\%} at high MP concentrations ({\textgreater}?1250?particles?mL?1) but was not affected at equivalent silt concentrations. These findings suggest high MP concentrations inhibit mussel CR, more than expected by changes in particle concentration or the proportion of abiotic particles. As plastic production increases, mussel exposure to MP will increase, potentially reducing energy transfer, benthic-pelagic coupling, and water clarity.},

Tests conducted in a flow chamber at {\textless}1 cm s(-1) were consistent with published clearance rates from standard tests involving unstirred containers (i.e., 60-70 mt mussel(-1).h(-1) for 11-mm-long mussels). Increasing ambient velocity up to similar to 10 cm.s(-1) led to clearance rates at least twice those of standard testing methods. Higher velocities (similar to 20 cm.s(-1)) were inhibitory and resulted in reduced clearance rates. There were no detectable differences in the clearance rates of D. polymorpha and D. bugensis of equal size tested at similar to 10 cm.s(-1), but large mussels had greater clearance rates than small ones. These results were found to be consistent with observations from marine bivalves and indicate that fluid dynamic issues are of importance in freshwater ecosystems, especially those that are shallow and (or) flowing. The trophic dynamics of these ecosystems will be better understood when the effects of fluid dynamics on the organism's ability to filter feed and the local delivery of seston through turbulent mixing are considered.},

abstract = {Motivation: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously.Results: We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10{\%} to 30{\%}. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract = {Recent research revealing the extent of marine habitat degradation has ignited a surge of restoration efforts globally. Restoration of estuarine habitats became a priority in the United States with the Estuary Restoration Act (ERA) of 2000. In the present study, a synthesis of data from the National Estuaries Restoration Inventory (NERI), developed in response to ERA requirements to track and disseminate project data, was conducted in order to analyze U.S. oyster reef restoration efforts. From 2000–2011, more than {\$}45 million was invested in 187 projects to restore over 150 ha of oyster reef habitat, with projects most heavily concentrated in the Chesapeake Bay area and Florida Gulf coast. Trends over time indicate that projects are being implemented at larger scales, increasing from an average of less than 0.4 ha in 2000 to over 1 ha on average in 2011. Costs per unit decreased from an average of more than {\$}2.1 million per ha in 2000 to just over {\$}500,000 per ha in 2011. However, our analysis confirms one major problem hindering the field of restoration ecology: a lack of monitoring data or project-specific assessments of success. Habitat restoration has become an increasingly common effort in the policy sector, and gaps identified through this analysis can help inform future policy making and implementation. Better facilitation of data dissemination and further research on economies of scale in restoration projects are two key areas for improvement. As the field of restoration ecology continues to grow, it is critical that both new and current restoration practitioners, scientists, and decision-makers are able to learn from past projects and apply that collective knowledge to future restoration efforts.},

abstract = {Since the late 1990s, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) has spread into the East Frisian Wadden Sea (Germany). This invasion provided an opportunity to study the population dynamics and the patterns of spread during the initial bioinvasion process. With its source area in The Netherlands, the bioinvasion continues in an eastward direction, as documented by a gradient of high abundances in the west and low abundances in the east during the first study year. One year later, abundances of the Pacific oyster were more heterogenic and differed between adjacent tidal basins. The increase in population sizes at all study sites was very high, reaching levels similar to native occurrence populations. The growth constant (K) varied between 0.300 and 0.990 year−1. The mussel bed with the highest densities had a mean abundance of {\textgreater}300 ind. m−2, and a maximum of 1,460 ind. m−2. Furthermore, the bioinvasion was facilitated by a low mortality (Z) found for populations between 0.5 and 1.5 years old (Z = 0.03–0.13 year−1). At present, Pacific oysters are well established at several locations in the East Frisian Wadden Sea and may become with these reproductive potential self-sustaining populations.},

The early isolation of Africa and Madagascar implies that the ostrich and extinct Madagascan elephant birds (Aepyornithidae) should be the oldest ratite lineages. We sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of two elephant birds and performed phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that these birds are the closest relatives of the New Zealand kiwi and are distant from the basal ratite lineage of ostriches. This unexpected result strongly contradicts continental vicariance and instead supports flighted dispersal in all major ratite lineages. We suggest that convergence toward gigantism and flightlessness was facilitated by early Tertiary expansion into the diurnal herbivory niche after the extinction of the dinosaurs.},

Generally, O. lurida was found to be widespread and abundant on the west coast of Vancouver Island, with populations forming dense reefs in many locations. The species was widespread in the Strait of Georgia, but abundance was relatively low and oysters tended to occupy cryptic habitats. Exceptions included moderately dense populations in Ladysmith Harbour, Hotham Sound and Jervis Inlet. The Gorge Waterway in Victoria Harbour was found to support abundant populations both in the intertidal and subtidal zones, with abundance increasing with depth. Previous observations of subtidal Olympia oyster reefs forming three-dimensional reef structures in the Gorge Waterway were confirmed. Further surveys are required on the north-western coast of Vancouver Island, Johnstone and Queen Charlotte Straits and North Coast to supplement the understanding of the distribution and abundance of the this species in British Columbia.},

abstract = {While many coastal ecosystems previously supported high densities of seagrass and abundant bivalves, the impacts of overfishing, eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and habitat loss have collectively contributed to the decline of these important resources. Despite improvements in wastewater treatment in some watersheds and subsequent reduced nutrient loading to neighboring estuaries, seagrass and bivalve populations in these locations have generally not recovered. We performed three mesocosm experiments to simultaneously examine the contrasting effects of nutrient loading and historic suspension-feeding bivalve densities on the growth of eelgrass (Zostera marina), juvenile bivalves (northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria; eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica; and bay scallops, Argopecten irradians), and juvenile planktivorous fish (sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon variegatus). High nutrient loading rates led to significantly higher phytoplankton (chlorophyll a) levels in all experiments, significantly increased growth of juvenile bivalves relative to controls with lower nutrient loading rates in two experiments, and significantly reduced the growth of eelgrass in one experiment. The filtration provided by adult suspension feeders (M. mercenaria and C. virginica) significantly decreased phytoplankton levels in all experiments, significantly increased light penetration and the growth of eelgrass in one experiment, and significantly decreased the growth of juvenile bivalves and fish in two experiments, all relative to controls with no filtration from adult suspension feeders. These results demonstrate that an appropriate level of nutrient loading can have a positive effect on some estuarine resources and that bivalve filtration can mediate the effects of nutrient loading to the benefit or detriment of different estuarine resources. Future ecosystem-based approaches will need to simultaneously account for anthropogenic nutrient loading and bivalve restoration to successfully manage estuarine resources.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {The Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida)‡ was historically abundant in Willapa Bay, WA, but populations were decimated by overexploitation in the mid to late-1800s and have failed to recover. We investigated the potential role of two introduced predatory gastropods, the Japanese drill (Ocinebrina inornata) and the eastern drill (Urosalpinx cinerea), in limiting Olympia oyster recovery.Wequantified the bay-wide distribution, local abundance, and per capita effects of drills, and asked how each of these three components of total invasion impact might be influenced by another dominant introduced species, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Bay-wide sampling revealed differences in spatial distribution of the two drill species, with U. cinerea more abundant toward the head of the estuary and O. inornata more abundant toward the mouth. Individual feeding trials indicated that both drill species preferred Pacific oysters to Olympia oysters of similar size, and preferentially attacked smaller oysters.Weused field enclosures to quantify the direct effects of Japanese drill predation on Olympia and Pacific oysters, intra and interspecific competition, and indirect effects mediated by the shared predator. Predation reduced the survival of both oyster species, but the per capita impact of Japanese drills declined with increasing density of either Olympia or Pacific oysters, consistent with a type II functional response. This positive indirect effect of Pacific oysters on Olympia oysters was offset by asymmetric competition, in which Pacific oysters reduced Olympia oyster growth and survival but not vice versa. Despite the large drill impacts seen in these experiments, Olympia oysters transplanted to intertidal sites throughout the bay experienced low and variable rates of drill predation compared with other mortality sources. Introduced drills may be only one of a suite of factors that prevent rebuilding of Olympia oysters in the intertidal zone in Willapa Bay},

abstract = {Ecosystem engineers are organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats. Autogenic engineers (e.g. corals, or trees) change the environment via their own physical structures (i.e. their living and dead tissues). Allogenic engineers (e.g. woodpeckers, beavers) change the environment by transforming living or non-living materials from one physical state to another, via mechanical or other means. The direct provision of resources to other species, in the form of living or dead tissues is not engineering. Organisms act as engineers when they modulate the supply of a resource or resources other than themselves. We recognise and define five types of engineering and provide examples. Humans are allogenic engineers par excellence, and also mimic the behaviour of autogenic engineers, for example by constructing glasshouses. We explore related concepts including the notions of extended phenotypes and keystone species. Some (but not all) products of ecosystem engineering are extended phenotypes. Many (perhaps most) impacts of keystone species include not only trophic effects, but also engineers and engineering. Engineers differ in their impacts. The biggest effects are attributable to species with large per capita impacts, living at high densities, over large areas for a long time, giving rise to structures that persist for millennia and that modulate many resource flows (e.g. mima mounds created by fossorial rodents). The ephemeral nests constructed by small, passerine birds lie at the opposite end of this continuum. We provide a tentative research agenda for an exploration of the phenom- enon of organisms as ecosystem engineers, and suggest that all habitats on earth support, and are influenced by, ecosystem engineers.},

Here, we use a global sample of 2062 species to provide evidence that metabolic and life history tradeoffs govern the evolution of brain size in birds and play an important role in defining the ecological strategies capable of persisting in Earth's most thermally variable and unpredictable habitats. While some birds cope with extreme winter conditions by investing in large brains (e.g., greater capacity for planning, innovation, and behavioral flexibility), others have small brains and invest instead in traits that allow them to withstand or recover from potentially deadly events. Specifically, these species are restricted to large body sizes, diets consisting of difficult-to-digest but readily available foods, and high reproductive output. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of considering strategic tradeoffs when investigating potential drivers of brain size evolution.},

abstract = {Modern agricultural practices pose serious threats to biodiversity worldwide. Species losses from habitat conversion are well documented, but indirect impacts such as reduced water availability to adjacent ecosystems are less known. San Quint{\'{i}}n is an important agricultural valley in the mediterranean climate region of Baja California, Mexico. The region is also a hotspot of plant species richness and endemism. Plant species in the region are here analyzed by comparison of the contemporary flora to historical botanical collections to identify extirpations. Historical collections indicate that habitat loss to agriculture has been a direct cause of species losses. As importantly, the unsustainable extraction of groundwater has apparently led to salt water intrusion, resulting in the loss of 22 native plant taxa, including 13 rare plants. Seventy-eight percent of all the vernal pool taxa have been lost from the flora (including 85 {\%} of the rare taxa) and 11 {\%} of plants of riparian and pond habitat (including 25 {\%} of the rare taxa) are no longer found in the region. Unsustainable agricultural practices continue to threaten fragile coastal ecosystems and are a serious challenge to current and future conservation efforts. Ironically, these same practices frequently result in abandonment of cultivated areas. Owing to indirect impacts, conservation of biodiversity and large-scale agricultural operations are even less compatible on a regional scale than indicated by direct impacts. It is vital that sustainable agricultural practices be adopted locally and globally to avoid further losses of biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

@article{Hickey2003,
abstract = {Ocean processes are generally large scale on the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast; this is true of both seasonal variations and event-scale upwelling-downwelling fluctuations, which are highly energetic. Coastal upwelling supplies most of the macronutrients available for production, although the intensity of upwelling-favorable wind forcing increases southward while primary production and chlorophyll are higher in the north, off the Washington coast. This discrepancy could be related to several mesoscale features: the wider, more gently sloping shelf to the north, the existence of numerous submarine canyons to the north, the availability of Columbia River plume water and sediment north of the river mouth, and the existence of a semi-permanent eddy offshore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. We suggest that these features have important effects on the magnitude and timing of macronutrient or micronutrient delivery to the plankton. These features are potentially important as well to transport pathways and residence times of planktonic larvae and to the development of harmful algal blooms. The coastal plain estuaries, with the exception of the Columbia River, are relatively small, with large tidal forcing and highly seasonal direct river inputs that are low to negligible during the growing season. Primary production in these estuaries is likely controlled not by river-driven stratification but by coastal upwelling and exchange with the ocean. Both baroclinic mechanisms (the gravitational circulation) and barotropic ones (lateral stirring by tide and, possibly, wind) contribute to this exchange. Because esmarine hydrography and ecology are so dominated by ocean signals, the coastal estuaries, like the coastal ocean, are largely synchronous on seasonal and event time scales, though intrusions of the Columbia River plume can cause strong asymmetries between Washington and Oregon estuaries especially during spring downwelling conditions. Water property correlation increases between spring and summer as wind forcing becomes more spatially coherent along the coast. Estuarine habitat is structured not only by large scale forcing but also by fine scale processes in the extensive intertidal zone, such as by solar heating or differential advection by tidal currents.},

abstract = {The accumulation of atmospheric [CO2] continues to warm and acidify oceans concomitant with local disturbances, such as eutrophication. These changes can modify plant– herbivore grazing interactions by affecting the physiology of grazers and by altering the nutri- tional value of plants. However, such environmental changes are often studied in isolation, pro- viding little understanding of their combined effects. We tested how ocean warming and acidifi- cation affect the per capita grazing by the sea urchin Amblypneustes pallidus on the seagrass Amphibolis antarctica and how such effects may differ between ambient and eutrophic nutrient conditions. Consistent with metabolic theory, grazing increased with warming, but in contrast to our expectations, acidification also increased grazing. While nutrient enrichment reduced graz ing, it did not fully counterbalance the increase associated with warming and acidification. Collec- tively, these results suggest that ocean warming and acidification may combine to strengthen top- down pressure by herbivores. Localised nutrient enrichment could ameliorate some of the increased per capita grazing effect caused by warming and acidification, provided other common negative effects of eutrophication on seagrass, including overgrowth by epiphytes and herbivore aggregation, are not overwhelming. There is value in assessing how global and local environmen- tal change will combine, often in non-intuitive ways, to modify biological interactions that shape habitats.},

Bah{\'{i}}a San Quint{\'{i}}n is a reverse estuary in Baja California, Mexico, where Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) are cultivated. While oysters likely feed heavily on phytoplankton especially during upwelling periods, we hypothesized that other forms of organic matter such as seagrass (Zostera marina) and macroalgae (Ulva spp.) must also be used by the oysters, especially in the most inshore portions of the bay. We measured the carbon and hydrogen stable isotope composition of oysters and their potential food resources at upper, mid, and lower bay sites during upwelling and non-upwelling seasons and applied a Bayesian mixing model to evaluate resource use. Hydrogen isotopes provided a large separation between potential food resources. Although we did not find any strong seasonal effects due to upwelling, there was a strong spatial gradient in resource use. Phytoplankton were most important at the lower (oceanic) site (median resource use for two sampling times, 68 and 79 {\%}) and decreased up the estuary as macroalgae became more important (43 and 56 {\%} at the upper site). At all sites for both sampling times, seagrass was an unimportant resource for oysters. The contrast between high phytoplankton use at the lower site and increased macroalgal use at the upper site is likely due to available resource biomass. Results indicate the adaptability of oysters to varying resource availability and the possibility of a higher system carrying capacity than that based on phytoplankton alone given multiple potential food sources. This study also highlights the utility of hydrogen isotopes in estuarine food web research.},

abstract = {Non-native species can alter ecosystem functions performed by native species often by displacing influential native species. However, little is known about how ecosystem functions may be modified by trait-mediated indirect effects of non-native species. Oysters and other reef-associated filter feeders enhance water quality by controlling nutrients and contaminants in many estuarine environments. However, this ecosystem service may be mitigated by predation, competition, or other species interactions, especially when such interactions involve non-native species that share little evolutionary history. We assessed trophic and other interference effects on the critical ecosystem service of water filtration in mesocosm experiments. In single-species trials, typical field densities of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) reduced water-column chlorophyll a more strongly than clams (Mercenaria mercenaria). The non-native filter-feeding reef crab Petrolisthes armatus did not draw down chlorophyll a. In multi-species treatments, oysters and clams combined additively to influence chlorophyll a drawdown. Petrolisthes did not affect net filtration when added to the bivalve-only treatments. Addition of the predatory mud crab Panopeus herbstii did not influence oyster feeding rates, but it did stop chlorophyll a drawdown by clams. However, when Petrolisthes was also added in with the clams, the clams filtered at their previously unadulterated rates, possibly because Petrolisthes drew the focus of predators or habituated the clams to crab stimuli. In sum, oysters were the most influential filter feeder, and neither predators nor competitors interfered with their net effect on water-column chlorophyll. In contrast, clams filtered less, but were more sensitive to predators as well as a facilitative buffering effect of Petrolisthes, illustrating that non-native species can indirectly affect an ecosystem service by aiding the performance of a native species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Byers et al.},

abstract = {Increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide is altering marine carbonate chemistry through a process called ocean acidification. Many calcium carbonate forming organisms are sensitive to changes in marine carbonate chemistry, especially mollusk bivalve larvae at the initial shell building stage. Rapid calcification, limited energy reserves, and more exposed calcification surfaces, are traits at this stage that increase vulnerability to ocean acidification through our previously argued kinetic-energetic hypothesis. These developmental traits are common to broadcast spawning bivalve species that are the focus of most ocean acidification studies to date. Some oyster species brood their young, which results in slower development of the embryos through the initial shell formation stage. We examined the responses of the brooding Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, during their initial shell building stage. We extracted fertilized eggs from, O. lurida, prior to shell develop- ment, then exposed developing embryos to a wide range of marine carbonate chemistry conditions. Surpris- ingly, O. lurida showed no acute negative response to any ocean acidification treatments. Compared to the broadcast spawning Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, calcification rate and standardized endogenous energy lipid consumption rate were nearly 10 and 50 times slower, respectively. Our results suggest that slow shell building may lessen the energetic burden of acidification at this stage and provides additional support for our kinetic-energetic hypothesis. Furthermore, these results may represent an example of exaptation; fitness conveyed by a coopted trait that evolved for another purpose, a concept largely lacking in the current per- spective of adaptation and global climate change.},

abstract = {Maryland's recently created oyster restored reefs provide us with a unique opportunity to observe the abundance and species composition of macrofauna assemblages on unexploited reefs with high concentrations of mature oysters and undisturbed reef architecture. They might thus be used to better understand the magnitude of losses to reef dwelling macrofauna communities, and the associated loss of ecological functions resulting from reef destruction. We sampled reef macrofaunal assemblages on restored plots at four restored oyster reefs and adjacent non-restored plots located outside restored boundaries. We then compared the effects of study site location, and habitat quality (restored versus non-restored) on macrofaunal density using thirteen response variables. Density of macrofauna was an order of magnitude higher on restored reefs, epifaunal density was more than twice as high on restored reefs and sessile macrofaunal density was two orders of magnitude higher on restored reefs. Three out of the five dominant taxonomic groups were much more abundant on restored plots. Mean amphipod density was 20 times higher on restored plots and densities of xanthid crabs and demersal fish were both four times greater on restored plots. Two out of four functional feeding groups: suspension feeders and carnivore/omnivores, were more abundant on restored plots. Since reef macrofauna include many important fish prey species, oyster reef restoration may have the potential to augment fish production by increasing fish prey densities and fish foraging efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

abstract = {The feeding activities of bivalve mollusks have direct impacts on suspended particles in nature. Feeding is also related to the carrying capacity of a particular system for maximal aquaculture production. Particle removal is known to be dependent upon particle characteristics, including size and type, because particle retention efficiency is size dependent, and bivalves are able to select particles actively to improve the quality of food ingested. Our goal was to quantify particle clearance by northern bay scallops of natural seston under semi-natural conditions, i.e., in raceway tanks receiving a constant flow of untreated, estuarine water. Particle clearance rate (CR) was determined based upon particle counts in tank inflow and outflow streams. A flow-cytometric technique was developed allowing rapid quantification of particles with different sizes and characterization by presence or absence of chlorophyll fluorescence simultaneously. CR varied greatly (ranging from 0.06 to 3.02 L h- 1 gDW- 1) among sizes and types of particles. CR of large particles was generally higher than that of the smaller particles. Under the specific conditions of this experiment, particle selectivity appeared to be ineffective because scallops did not show a higher CR on phytoplankton than on detritus. This study demonstrated the feasibility of this flow-cytometric approach to measure differential clearance of different particles in natural seston by suspension-feeding organisms.},

abstract = {Time-series of hourly clearance, ingestion and absorption rates and absorption efficiency were measured over 48 h for adult sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) held in situ in a coastal embayment in Nova Scotia, Canada, during a wind-induced resuspension event. Temporal variations in oceanographic variables, and seston quantity and composition (organic matter, organic carbon, nitrogen, chlorophyll a, and inorganic particle size spectra) were monitored during the study with moored instruments and hourly water sampling. Resuspension of bottom materials during the storm resulted in large changes in the amount (1 to 30 mg l-1 total particulate matter) and nutritional quality (25 to 50{\%} organic content) of seston. High sedimentation rates after the storm were accelerated by flocculation, resulting in the rapid settling of resuspended particles and an increase in seston quality. Observed short-term (hourly) fluctuations in clearance rate were not related to storm- or tide-induced changes in seston characteristics but were directly related to flow velocity. Significantly lower clearance rates were observed at relatively low ({\textless} 4 cm s-1) and high ({\textgreater} 9 cm s-1) flow speeds. The overall reduction in ingestion rates after the storm resulted from decreased food availability. Hourly absorption efficiency (AE) measurements were closely related to seston quality (total organic, organic C and N content) and AE declined exponentially with decreasing seston quality. Reductions in AE during the resuspension event were offset by the increased ingestion rate, resulting in no significant changes in absorption rates for organic matter, C, or N over the sampling period. As the low food quality of the resuspended matter was balanced by increased availability, any physiological regulation of food acquisition (i.e. clearance rate regulation) would have been irrelevant to maintaining food intake constant.},

abstract = {Microplastics are now synonymous with human impacts on the environment and as a threat to marine organisms. Numerous taxa are at risk from microplastics including commercially valuable bivalves as seafood, which are also disproportionately important as biogenic reef-forming species that enhance biodiversity such that they are commonly protected under conservation actions. As a sessile filter-feeding organism, bivalves are highly susceptible to microplastic ingestion but despite their socio-economic and ecological importance, no research has been undertaken to assess how a reef's structural arrangement might affect plastic ingestion. Here, using a series of flume experiments, we examined how change in spatial arrangement of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, interacts with different flow speeds to effect retention of microplastic over reef surfaces and ingestion risk by individual mussels. Our results show that clumped spatial arrangements reduce boundary layer velocities, and increase turbulence, boundary layer thickness and plastic retention over reef surfaces under faster flow conditions, increasing plastic ingestion by 3-fold. Our findings suggest that the structural arrangement and rugosity of natural reef structures may create natural sinks of anthropogenic pollution, and species like Mytilus that are also important species for human consumption, while disproportionately susceptible to microplastic pollution, may be useful bioindicators of microplastic pollution.},

abstract = {Feeding, selection and absorption were determined for the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas cultivated in the Bay of Marennes-Oleron, over a spring/neap tidal cycle. Physiological determinations were related to the highly variable food environment with continuous recordings of turbidity and fluorescence. In this bay, resuspension processes have a major influence on food availability and quality. Seston characteristics experienced by oysters can be summarized by high turbidity levels from 20 to 350 mg ?? l-1 and a predominance of the detritic fraction among the organic fraction (mean C/N ratio = 16.57). Food is diluted by the fine resuspended sediment, and organic content of particulate matter in the water column decreases from 30{\%} to 10{\%} with increasing seston loads. Significant differences (Ancova, P {\textless} 0.01), due to low retention efficiencies of the smaller particle size range, were recorded between the food quality (estimated by the organic content and the total pigment content) measured in the water column and the fraction retained by the oyster's gill. Below seston concentrations of 90 mg ?? l-1 ingestion rate was regulated by pseudofaecal production. Above 90 mg ?? l-1 , a sharp reduction of filtration and rejection rates suggests physical constraints limiting food acquisition. The oyster selectively rejects inorganic from organic particlesm, enriching the ingested fraction. Amongst the potentially nutritive particles, significantly fewer particles containing phytopigments were rejected relative to organic particles (non-linear regressions, P {\textless} 0.001). The negative influence, through food dilution, of high seston loads on net absorption efficiency was determined. This efficiency decreases with decreasing organic ingested fraction. Scope for growth calculations confirm the negative influence of seston loads, but show, supported by field growth measurements, that resuspended organic particles play an important role in the oyster's nutrition.},

Globally, bivalves have higher production than any other cultured animal. Large populations of natural, invasive, and cultured bivalves are suggested to cause changes in coastal ecosystem function through suspension-feeding of particles and biodeposition of waste materials. Association of bivalves with particle depletion is a trophic tenet of coastal ecosystems, but there are no previous observations of this process except at small scales. Using airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, we show direct evidence of aquaculture impacts at the ecosystem scale (kilometres), documenting significant depletion of phytoplankton through a blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) farm in eastern Canada, compared with dispersion in circulation model results without mussels. Understanding of factors controlling primary production and ecosystem processes in the coastal zone is critical in light of growing reliance on this region for development and resource extraction worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.},

abstract = {The ability of oysters to remove large quantities of particulates from the water column, thereby potentially improving water quality, has been cited as one of the reasons for oyster reef restoration. However, this ability has not yet been effectively demonstrated in the field. As part of the Alabama Oyster Reef Restoration Project, this study was designed to assess impacts of restored eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs on primary production, nutrient dynamics, and water quality in shallow tidal creeks. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design, we monitored tidal creeks around Dauphin Island, AL, for changes induced by the introduction of oyster reefs. Reef placement resulted in increased ammonium (NH4+) in two of the three experimental creeks. Interestingly, oyster reefs did not seem to reduce water column particulates or have an impact on phytoplankton or microphytobenthic biomass or productivity. We do not believe that our data discount the importance and/or usefulness of oysters in modifying the water column. Rather, we acknowledge that it is difficult to detect these impacts/environmental services in this type of system (i. e., a tidal creek system), because they seem to be very localized and short-lived (i. e., not ecologically relevant on a creek-wide scale). This study highlights the need to consider location and habitat in planning oyster restoration projects. Also, it demonstrates that the types, magnitudes, and spatial extent of changes in ecosystem services that should be expected after reef restoration might need to be re-evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2010 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.},

Surveys spanning 250 km of southeastern US coastline reveal spatially dispersed mussel mounds increased cordgrass survival during severe drought by 5-to 25-times. Surveys and mussel addition experiments indicate this positive effect of mussels on cordgrass was due to mounds enhancing water storage and reducing soil salinity stress. Observations and models then demonstrate that surviving cordgrass patches associated with mussels function as nuclei for vegetative re-growth and, despite covering only 0.1–12{\%} of die-offs, markedly shorten marsh recovery periods. These results indicate that mutualisms, in supporting stress-resistant patches, can play a disproportionately large, keystone role in enhancing ecosystem resilience to climatic extremes.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Despite the interest in restoring remnant populations of the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida Carpenter 1864,† little is known about connectivity among populations. Identifying the sources of settling larvae could broaden our understanding of the degree towhich particular populations are reliant on their neighbors for their persistence.Calcified structures such as the otoliths of fish andstatoliths of invertebrates are increasingly being exploited as useful ‘‘natural tags'' thathelp track individualmovements and, when applicable to larvae, could help to pinpoint important source populations. In controlled laboratory culturing experiments, we explored the prospects for using the chemistry of larval shells (prodissoconchs) as natural tags of larval source by examiningwhether larval shells record shifts in seawater element chemistry, whether larval shells undergo ontogenetic shifts in element uptake, and whether the chemistry of the shell formed during brooding is compromised by subsequent shell thickening during the planktonic phase. Results froma two-wayANOVAexamining the effect of seawater element concentration and ontogeny showed that element/ Ca in the shell increased in response to increasing seawater elemental concentrations for Ba, Ce, Pb, andMn, whereas shell Cu/Ca did not change. Ostrea lurida shell chemistry also showed strong ontogenetic shifts in element/Ca for Mg, Sr, and Cu during the transition from larva to settler. Settler shellMg/Ca strongly increased compared with planktonic shell, whereas Sr/Ca and Cu/Ca showed the opposite pattern. Further, the chemistry of the shell formed during brooding (at the birth location) did change as a function of environmental conditions experienced during the planktonic phase for the elements Ba and Ce, but that change was limited to regions of the brooded shell just adjacent to the planktonic shell.When the brooded portions of larval shellswere sampled closer to the umbo, the brooded shells? chemistry remains intact. The combined results suggest that larval Ostrea lurida shells act as recorders of environmental change and show promise as tools to track larval movements},

abstract = {To evaluate the effect of filter-feeding bivalves on water quality, batch and flow type measurements were recorded to estimate the respiration and ingestion rates of Musculista senhousia, which predominates the macrobenthos of Lake Nakaumi, Japan. The results for the respiration rate experiments had a low stable rate at about 15 mg O2 day-1 DFW g-1 (where DFW means dry flesh weight) at low temperatures (between 5°C and 10°C) that increased at middle and high temperatures (from 10°C to 30°C), reaching a maximum rate of about 200 mg O2 day-1 DFW g-1 at 30°C. The dependence of respiration rate on temperature is significant, especially between 10°C and 15°C (Q10 = 6.9). The vertical 2-BOX numerical model showed that continuous stratification of the water column must be averted if M. senhousia are to survive. Ingestion rate of particulate matter also increased with temperature between 10°C and 20°C. Ingestion rates at 30°C, after being incubated for more than 1 day, were almost the same as ingestion rates at 20°C. Filtration rates were calculated from concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl.a), particulate total phosphorus (PTP) and particulate total nitrogen (PTN). Obvious differences were observed between the filtration rate calculated from the Chl.a concentration compared to those from PTP and PTN. This may imply that M. senhousia selectively ingested a particular species of phytoplankton. The horizontal 2-BOX model showed a relationship between the Chl.a concentration in L. Nakaumi and the water exchange rate. The ingestion potential of organic matter by M. senhousia is greater than those of the nutrient loads in the field and has less risk of depleting dissolved oxygen (DO) in the bottom layer. If, therefore, the phosphorus and nitrogen supply to M. senhousia increased, and adult M. senhousia are collected and removed efficiently, water quality in L. Nakaumi would improve.

abstract = {While many coastal ecosystems previously supported high densities of seagrass and abundant bivalves, the impacts of overfishing, eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and habitat loss have collectively contributed to the decline of these important resources. Despite improvements in wastewater treatment in some watersheds and subsequent reduced nutrient loading to neighboring estuaries, seagrass and bivalve populations in these locations have generally not recovered. We performed three mesocosm experiments to simultaneously examine the contrasting effects of nutrient loading and historic suspension-feeding bivalve densities on the growth of eelgrass (Zostera marina), juvenile bivalves (northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria; eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica; and bay scallops, Argopecten irradians), and juvenile planktivorous fish (sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon variegatus). High nutrient loading rates led to significantly higher phytoplankton (chlorophyll a) levels in all experiments, significantly increased growth of juvenile bivalves relative to controls with lower nutrient loading rates in two experiments, and significantly reduced the growth of eelgrass in one experiment. The filtration provided by adult suspension feeders (M. mercenaria and C. virginica) significantly decreased phytoplankton levels in all experiments, significantly increased light penetration and the growth of eelgrass in one experiment, and significantly decreased the growth of juvenile bivalves and fish in two experiments, all relative to controls with no filtration from adult suspension feeders. These results demonstrate that an appropriate level of nutrient loading can have a positive effect on some estuarine resources and that bivalve filtration can mediate the effects of nutrient loading to the benefit or detriment of different estuarine resources. Future ecosystem-based approaches will need to simultaneously account for anthropogenic nutrient loading and bivalve restoration to successfully manage estuarine resources.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {In many areas of the North American mid-Atlantic coast, seagrass beds are either in decline or havedisappeared due, in part, to high turbidity that reduces the light reaching the plant surface. Because of this reductionin the areal extent of seagrass beds there has been a concomitant diminishment in dampening of water movement (wavesand currents) and sediment stabilization. Due to ongoing declines in stocks of suspension-feeding eastern oysters (Crassostreavirginica) in the same region, their feeding activity, which normally serves to improve water clarity, has beensharply reduced. We developed and parameterized a simple model to calculate how changes in the balance betweensediment sources (wave-induced resuspension) and sinks (bivalve filtration, sedimentation within seagrass beds) regulateturbidity. Changes in turbidity were used to predict the light available for seagrass photosynthesis and the amount ofcarbon available for shoot growth. We parameterized this model using published observations and data collected specificallyfor this purpose. The model predicted that when sediments were resuspended, the presence of even quite modestlevels of eastern oysters (25 g dry tissue weight m22) distributed uniformly throughout the modeled domain, reducedsuspended sediment concentrations by nearly an order of magnitude. This increased water clarity, the depth to whichseagrasses were predicted to grow. Because hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) had a much lower weight-specific filtrationrate than eastern oysters; their influence on reducing turbidity was much less than oysters. Seagrasses, once establishedwith sufficiently high densities (.1,000 shoots m22), damped waves, thereby reducing sediment resuspension and improvinglight conditions. This stabilizing effect was minor compared to the influence of uniformly distributed easternoysters on water clarity. Our model predicted that restoration of eastern oysters has the potential to reduce turbidity inshallow estuaries, such as Chesapeake Bay, and facilitate ongoing efforts to restore seagrasses. This model includedseveral simplifying assumptions, including that oysters were uniformly distributed rather than aggregated into offshorereefs and that oyster feces were not resuspended.},

abstract = {Benthic deposition of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)-rich oyster biodeposits may increase denitrification, or anaerobic respiration of nitrate (NO3 (-)) to di-nitrogen gas (N-2). However, environmental drivers of C and N dynamics in oyster biodeposits and reef-adjacent sediments require clarification. In July 2012, we collected intact sediment cores adjacent to and 15-20 m away from two oyster reefs (Crassostrea virginica) in Great Bay, New Hampshire, USA: one reference site and one site with cultural eutrophication. We also measured seston, chlorophyll a, and in situ oyster feeding and biodeposition. Cores were incubated in continuous-flow chambers where inflow water received N-15-ammonium (NH4 (+)), (NO3)-N-15 (-), or no isotopes (control). We quantified fluxes of dissolved nutrients and gasses (oxygen, N-28(2), N-29(2), N-30(2), and argon) after 24 h. Finally, we measured size-fractionated sediment organic matter. At the eutrophic site, abundant phytoplankton in the 5-28 A mu m size range was correlated with enhanced oyster feeding rates and biodeposit quality (lower C:N). This site had greater denitrification rates in reef-adjacent cores relative to distal cores. Low production of N-29,30(2) in (NH4)-N-15 (+) amended cores suggested water column or biodeposit NH4 (+) were unlikely to be converted to N-2. At both sites, reef-adjacent cores had more shell and higher N-29,30(2) production with (NO3)-N-15 (-) addition relative to distal cores, suggesting direct denitrification enhancement near reefs. Oysters likely increased sediment N-2 production via high quality biodeposits (eutrophic site), and NO3 (-) diffusion via structural complexity of reef-adjacent sediment (both sites). Overall, results suggest oyster-mediated ecosystems services may be expected to vary with environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Historical scenarios of evolution of avian plumage coloration have been called into question with the discoveries that most birds can see UV light (which normal humans cannot), and that UV-reflecting plumages are widespread in birds. Several examples of sexual dichromatism not detectable with human visual capabilities suggest that our categorizations of plumages as sexually mono- or dichromatic might often be incorrect. Nonetheless, given the limited taxonomic scope of those examples, the vast majority of sexually monochromatic birds are still treated as such without question in avian research. Herein, I show that {\textgreater}90{\%} of 139 species, in a broad sampling of presumed sexually monochromatic passerine birds, were actually sexually dichromatic from an avian visual perspective, based on comparisons of plumage reflectance data using a visual model of color discrimination thresholds. The taxonomic ubiquity of this result suggests that many existing interpretations of evolutionary patterns of sexual dichromatism in birds are erroneous. The visual model used herein provides a method for quantifying sexual dichromatism, revealing that most (58.7{\%}) feather patches sampled lie along a continuum of dichromatism between avian and human discriminatory abilities and could represent unrecognized sexually selected signals. Sexual dichromatism in this study rarely resulted from intersexual differences in UV coloration alone, emphasizing the need for analysis of bird coloration in relation to the full extent of avian visual discriminatory abilities, including, but not limited to, UV-visual capabilities.},

abstract = {Bivalves have been grown and transported for culture for hundreds of years and the introduction of some species outside of their native range for aquaculture has been suggested to be one of the greatest modes of introduction of exotic marine species. However, there has yet to be a thorough assessment of the importance of aquaculture and bivalve culture in particular, to the introduction and spread of exotic species. This paper reviews some of the environmental and ecological implications of the relationship between bivalve aquaculture and the introduction and spread of exotic species, management implications and mitigation strategies. Two broad classes of introductions of exotic species may result from activities associated with bivalve aquaculture. First, the intentional introduction of exotic species into an area for aquaculture purposes, i.e. the “target” species. These are typically foundation or engineering species and may have a considerable influence on receiving ecosystems. Second, the introduction of species that are either associated with introduced bivalves or facilitated by aquaculture activities (i.e. structures or husbandry practices). These may include both “hitchhiking” species (organisms that grow in association with or may be transferred with cultured bivalves) and disease causing organisms. Management options should include the use of risk assessments prior to transfers and quarantines. Various types of mitigation for exotic species have been evaluated but are generally not very successful. Because the risk of exotic species to ecosystems and the bivalve farming industry itself may be great, effort should be directed to better predict and halt introductions of potentially harmful species.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Mussels Mytilus edulis L. were fed a mixed diet comprising 2 algal species and ashed silt at a range of concentrations simulating natural conditions both above and below the level at which pseudofaeces were produced. Rates of ingestion increased to an asymptotic value at the highest concentration tested. Although gut passage times declined with increasing ingestion rate, efficiencies of food absorption remained relatively constant, probably signifying a balance between total gut contents and the rate of production of digestive enzymes. Measured physiological rates were similar to those recorded for mussels in the natural habitat. Respiration rates increased exponentially with increased rates of absorption, and the scope for growth was linearly related to absorbed ration, reaching a maximum value at the highest ration concentrations tested. The metabolic costs of feeding and growth represented 16 {\%} of the absorbed ration at twice the maintenance requirement, and increased to 22 {\%} at 4x maintenance. Despite these increased respiratory losses, we conclude that the limits to growth are set primarily by constraints on feeding behaviour, particularly on the processes of digestion and absorption. the},

abstract = {Under future ocean acidification (OA), increased availability of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in seawater may enhance seagrass productivity. However, the ability to utilise additional DIC could be regulated by light availability, often reduced through land runoff. To test this, two tropical seagrass species, Cymodocea serrulata and Halodule uninervis were exposed to two DIC concentrations (447 $\mu$atm and 1077 $\mu$atm pCO2), and three light treatments (35, 100, 380 $\mu$mol m-2 s-1) for two weeks. DIC uptake mechanisms were separately examined by measuring net photosynthetic rates while subjecting C. serrulata and H. uninervis to changes in light and addition of bicarbonate (HCO3-) use inhibitors (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide) and TRIS buffer (pH 8.0). We observed a strong dependence on energy driven H+-HCO3- co-transport (TRIS, which disrupts H+ extrusion) in C. serrulata under all light levels, indicating greater CO2 dependence in low light. This was confirmed when, after two weeks exposure, DIC enrichment stimulated maximum photosynthetic rates (Pmax) and efficiency ($\alpha$) more in C. serrulata grown under lower light levels (36-60{\%} increase) than for those in high light (4{\%} increase). However, C. serrulata growth increased with both DIC enrichment and light levels. Growth, NPP and photosynthetic responses in H. uninervis increased with higher light treatments and were independent of DIC availability. Furthermore, H. uninervis was found to be more flexible in HCO3- uptake pathways. Here, light availability influenced productivity responses to DIC enrichment, via both carbon fixation and acquisition processes, highlighting the role of water quality in future responses to OA.},

abstract = {In order to examine the importance of the settling of large particles to the food supply and feeding behavior of a benthic culture of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, we investigated the tidal dynamics of large ({\textgreater}0.5 mm diameter) marine aggregates, commonly known as marine snow, during three tidal cycles in July 1998 at a shallow, subtidal, low current flow regime site along the coast of Maine (Shorey Cove, Roque Island, Englishman's Bay, Maine). In situ, optically measured marine snow showed a distinct tidal signal displaying an increase in size and abundance through high tide with a peak on the early ebb tide as it settled to the bottom. Marine snow volume ranged an order of magnitude through the tidal cycle, from under 8 to over 80 mm3 l -1. An increase in the in situ marine snow volume corresponded with an increase in benthic mussel feeding activity (from 20{\%} to 60{\%} of maximum exhalant siphon area, which is an estimate of pumping rate) and maximum rates of pseudofeces production by the mussels during periods of low tidal current speeds. In contrast, mussels from the same population feeding on surface waters in shipboard chambers produced no pseudofeces and had high pumping rates (80-100{\%} maximum exhalant siphon area) over the whole tidal period. A second peak in benthic mussel pumping rates also occurred during flood tide. Food quality was lower in the bottom waters due to significantly higher particulate inorganic matter (PIM, {\textgreater}2 mg l-1) when compared with the surface waters. PIM accounted for 95{\%} of the total settled mass flux of 3.4 g m -2 day-1 measured in sediment traps deployed 1 m off the bottom, with organic carbon representing only 2.5{\%} of the mass flux during the mid-summer conditions. At low-current sites such as Shorey Cove, Roque Island, Maine, the settling of marine snow provides an important additional source of food, albeit of low quality, to benthic populations of blue mussels. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {As oceans and many estuaries become more acidic, identifying adaptable or nonadaptable species (“winners” or “losers”) will enable better predictions of community and ecosystem function alterations due to climate change. Marine bivalves are frequently subjects of ocean acidification (OA) research because of their perceived vulnerability, which also threatens loss of their valuable ecosystem services. Studies indicate that larvae of many broadcast spawning oyster and mussel species are physiologically sensitive to alterations in carbonate chemistry. Running counter to this trend are recent investigations of brooding oyster species (genus Ostrea) that suggest their offspring may be considerably more resistant to OA stress. Although the precise mechanism conferring OA resistance to Ostrea larvae is unknown, a strong candidate appears to be exaptation of traits developing embryos that require to cope with adverse carbonate conditions they typically encounter in the brood chamber. New and previously reported data on Ostrea brood chamber conditions are discussed in the context of OA. Novel technical and experimental approaches are offered to address current knowledge gaps in future studies.},

abstract = {Ecosystem engineers that inhabit coastal and estuarine environments, such as reef building oysters, do not only stabilise the sediment within their reefs, but their influence might also extend far outside their reefs, affecting tidal flat morphology and protecting the surrounding soft-sediment environment against erosion. However, quantitative information is largely missing, and the spatially extended ecosystem engineering effects on the surrounding soft-sediment largely unstudied. To quantify this, we measured elevations around eleven natural Crassostrea gigas reefs occurring on tidal flats in the Oosterschelde estuary (the Netherlands). These tidal flats experience strong erosion as a consequence of human interventions in the system. Various reef sizes were chosen to test the proportional effects of reefs on tidal flat morphology. Measurements were used to create 3-dimensional surface maps to obtain properties of the reefs and the surrounding soft-sediment environment. The area of the oyster reefs ranged from 2 to 1,908 m2. Reef length varied between 1 and 61 m, reef width between 1 and 45 m, and reef height between 0.20 and 1.08 m. Reefs varied in shape, going from round shape structures to more elongated ones.We observed elevated areas ({\textgreater}5 cm elevation from the background intertidal slope) on the lee side of all reefs, caused by the interaction between the reef's structure and locally prevailing wave conditions. The elevated area (i.e. the spatially extended ecosystem engineering effect) affected by the reef was of the same order of magnitude as the reef area. The elevated area was related to reef properties such as reef length, width, and height. Reef length, however, appeared to be the best predictor. These findings contribute to management solutions for coastal adaptation and protection. Our study clearly showed that oyster reefs not only protect the tidal flat under their footprint, but as well an area beyond the boundary of the reef.},

abstract = {Clearance and ingestion rates, absorption efficiencies and respiration rates were measured in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk of different lengths (53 to 89 mm) and age (10 to 24 mo) from cultivation rafts in the Ria de Arosa (Galicia, Spain). The experiments were carried out either in the laboratory, using monoalgal food (Isochrysis galbana) with an organic content of 91{\%}, or under natural conditions of food availability in cultivation rafts with seston, the organic content of which ranged from 33 to 69{\%}. Food concentrations ranged from 0.57 to 1.00 mg l-1 of total particulate matter (TPM), a load which is below the threshold for the production of pseudofaeces in Mytilus. These experiments proved that the ingestion rate (IR = mg TPM h-1) of food increases with the size of the mussel (measured as g of soft-tissue dry weight [DW]) according to the power equation IR = 12.661DW0.619, this model accounting for over 90{\%} of the variance of the IR. Behavioural patterns that tended to maintain constant IR regardless of the density of the food were observed. Absorption efficiency (AE) is positively related to the organic content (OC) of the food according to the following hyperbolic equation: AE = 1.015-0.163(1/OC) (r = 0.940). AE is independent of mussel size for most of the size range used in this study, but there is a critical length around 85 mm, above which there is a noticeable decrease of AE. Metabolic expenditure, measured in terms of oxygen consumption standardized per unit of dry weight of flesh, tends to increase with the age of the mussel. The results obtained led to the conclusion that physiological traits such as the regulation of ingestion or differences in AE between groups do not explain the differences in growth between mussels of the same age. These differences must therefore be due to the limited food and space available as a result of the large numbers of mussels on the cultivation rafts and the agglomeration of mussels on the cultivation ropes.},

France, decreased from 28 to 8 {\%} with mcreasing seston concentration from 10 to about 90 mg total particulate mass 1(1). Throughout this tidal variation, the blue mussel Mylilus edulis L. cleared more water of particles as seston availability increased. Rejection of fillered material as pseudofaeces prior to ingestion remained a constant fraction of about 0 .93 x the mass of filtered material, so that ingestion rate showed no signs of stabilising at even the highest food availabillties. We confirm that M. edulis may preferentially reject inorganic matter with pseudofaeces. More significant was the novel observation that the net selection efficiency with which filtered organics were selectively retained for ingestion increased rapidly with the rate at which seston was filtered, this increase being faster for seston of higher organic content. The result was that the organic content of ingested matter was enriched by up to 5 times the organic content of filtered particles. Further, net absorption efficiency for ingested organics varied in strong positive relation with the organic content of ingested material. Therefore, rates of organic absorption increased with seston filtration rate, and net energy balance increased despite the decreasing organic content of particles available at higher concentrations. These collective find ings demonstrate continuous interrelated changes in feeding physiology that help to maintain rates of nutrient acquisition independent of short-term fluctuations in seston composition.},

Worldwide oyster population declines have been dramatic and efforts to restore declining populations and the services they provide are ongoing. Several commonly used oyster restoration techniques were examined to determinewhich would be themost successful for restoring theOlympia oysterOstrea lurida inNewport Bay, CA. Replicate (n¼5) 232 mshell beds were constructed of two initial shell planting thicknesses (bed thicknesses of 4 versus 12 cm) and two methods of deployment (bagged versus loose shell). Shell cover, oyster spatfall (settlement), oyster recruitment, and adult oyster densities were analyzed over 2 y; 12-cm-thick oyster beds maintained higher shell cover, experienced less sedimentation, and received greater numbers of oyster recruits than 4-cm-thick beds. There was no significant effect of shell deployment method on shell cover, recruitment, or adult density; however, spatfallwas greater onloose shell beds comparedwithbagged shell beds in the final yearof the study. Overall, augmenting mudflat habitat with oyster shell significantly increased adult O. lurida oyster density compared with unmanipulated plots and increased oyster density relative to the average density of oysters measured elsewhere in Newport Bay. Collectively, the data suggest that building thicker shell beds might increase the longevity of a constructed shell bed, and therefore, this approach is recommended for future restoration activities in southern California. This study highlights the advantages of augmenting habitat in a manner that provides vertical relief from sedimentation.},

The presence of both oyster species was manipulated in intertidal and subtidal habitats and reefs were constructed at horizontal and vertical orientation to the substratum. After 12 months, species diversity and benthic assemblage structure between assemblages with C. gigas and O. edulis were similar, but differed between habitats and orientation, suggesting that both oyster species were functionally similar in terms of biodiversity facilitation. These findings support evidence, that non-native species could play an important role in maintaining biodiversity in systems with declining populations of native species.},

abstract = {The native Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, was once abundant in many US Pacific Northwest (PNW) estuaries, but was decimated by human activity in the late nineteenth early to twentieth centuries. Having been the subject of only few modern, detailed studies, a dearth of basic physiological information surrounded O. lurida and how it compared to the now dominant, non-native Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Utilizing laboratory and in situ studies in Yaquina Bay, OR, we explored the clearance rates of both species across a wide range of conditions. Pacific oysters not only had greater size-specific clearance rates than Olympia oysters, but also had a lower optimum temperature. Clearance rates for both species were reduced at lower salinity, at lower organic content, and at higher turbidity. Clearance rate models were constructed for each species using three approaches: (1) a single mechanistic model that incorporated feeding response functions of each species to the effects of temperature, salinity, turbidity, and seston organic content based on laboratory studies; (2) another additive model in which the number and type of response functions from laboratory studies were allowed to vary; and (3) a statistical model that utilized environmental data collected during in situ feeding trials. Clearance rate models that correlated feeding activity with in situ environmental data were found to often better predict oyster clearance rates (based on Adj R 2) for both species in Yaquina Bay, OR, than mechanistic, additive models based on laboratory feeding response functions; however, in situ correlative models varied in accuracy by species and season. This work represents important first steps towards better understanding the physiological ecology of the native Olympia oyster and how it differs from introduced and now dominant Pacific oyster.},

abstract = {The natural diets of the introduced suspension-feeders Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) and Crepidula fornicata (L.) were determined at a mid-latitudinal oyster-farming site within their European range (Bourgneuf Bay, France). Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope deviations of Pacific oysters and slipper limpets were compared with potential food sources on 3 sampling dates (March, July and November 2003). Four end-members were assimilated by the 2 species: C 3 angiosperm detritus, macroalgae-C4 plant detritus, marine phytoplankton and benthic diatoms. Given the lack of source digestibility data for suspension-feeders, and these 2 species in particular, extreme feasible combinations of relative end-member contributions were calculated according to 2 assimilation scenarios, using either IsoSource software or a concentration-dependent model. For both Crassostrea gigas and Crepidula fornicata, benthic and planktonic microalgae dominated diets on the 3 sampling dates. Planktonic microalgae were ingested in greater proportions than benthic species in July and November; however, benthic diatoms also formed a constant and significant part of diets in these months, and were consumed in greater proportions than planktonic species in March. Plant (especially macroalgal) detritus played a major role in the diets of the 2 suspension-feeders, notably in March 2003 when it became the principal ingested source. The substantial contribution of plant detritus to the natural diets of these species has not previously been reported. Although Crassostrea gigas and Crepidula fornicata showed significantly different isotopic deviations in March and July 2003, trophic niches of Crassostrea gigas and Crepidula fornicata overlapped on all 3 sampling dates, with a greater ingestion of identical sources in November. These 2 invasive species could therefore be trophic competitors in the context of end-member supply limitation. Contrary to previous analyses conducted on these 2 species in Europe, this study reports significant dietary overlap. Ecosystem-specific diet studies of invasive species are thus necessary in order to understand trophic overlap/ competition as a function of the diversity and availability of local food sources. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract = {The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas was introduced in Europe for commercial purposes in the mid 1960s. It was initially thought that low winter temperatures would restrain this species' reproduction and settlement; however, its present distribution in areas where no introduction has taken place suggests that natural invasion and expansion has occurred. Along the European coast, wild populations of Pacific oysters are already found from northern Germany to southern Portugal. Whether C. gigas will continue to further expand through northern waters will depend on its physiological performance. In this study, the performance of wild oyster populations has been studied in terms of growth and reproduction at three stations: La Rochelle (France; 46??N), Yerseke (Oosterschelde estuary, The Netherlands, 51??N), and Texel (Wadden Sea estuary, The Netherlands, 53??N). The French population had the lowest somatic-shell mass ratio and an increase in maximum shell length, somatic and gonadal mass was observed from France to the Netherlands. In addition, mean oocyte diameter decreased significantly from south to north. The combination of increasing gonadal mass and decreasing oocyte volume suggests an increasing reproductive output in terms of egg numbers from France to The Netherlands. Differences in temperature between locations will at least be partly responsible for the observed patterns; however, other environmental factors (such as food availability, predation pressure, sediment type and/or seston concentration) cannot be excluded. Since smaller eggs (oocytes) are thought to have a longer development time, the environmental conditions along the Dutch coast may result in increased larval dispersal and possibly in further population expansion. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Measurements of seabed drag coefficient, C100, were made under tidal currents at four sites in Mahurangi Harbour, New Zealand. At the first three sites the dominant roughness element was the pinnid bivalve, Atrina zelandica (horse mussel). At the fourth site, which was devoid of horse mussels but covered in cockle shells, patches of seaweed and crab burrows, C100 was smallest (0.0055), but still twice as large as the value typically applied to abiotic, flat, cohesionless seabeds (0.0025). The mean drag coefficient plus-or-minus standard error at the three sites with horse mussels was: 0.0082±0.0010 (site 1); 0.0096±0.0009 (site 2); 0.0115±0.0016 (site 3). There were no clear differences amongst sites 1,2 and 3 in terms of the attributes of individual horse mussels (e.g. shell height, width or orientation), which could have been used to explain the ranking of the drag coefficients. There were, however, differences amongst the three sites in terms of spatial distribution of individual bivalves. The site with the highest density of horse mussels, site 1, had the lowest drag coefficient and an areal concentration ($\lambda$) of horse mussels higher than typical values cited for the critical concentration ($\lambda$c) for the onset of skimming flow over various idealized, three-dimensional roughness elements. At sites 2 and 3, the drag coefficient was given by: C100=[k/ln(3000/mk$\lambda$)]2 which was valid for $\lambda${\textless}$\lambda$c, where k is von Karman's constant, k is the horse mussel height (i.e., protusion above the seabed), m≃100 and $\lambda$c≃0.2. The stable eddies that are hypothesized to lodge between roughness elements at concentrations greater than $\lambda$c may influence benthic community dynamics.},

abstract = {Biogenic reefs formed by dense aggregations of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica are a dominant feature in most estuarine systems along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Oyster reefs are complex in their structural nature and have long been recognized for their potential habitat value. However, relatively few studies have characterized nekton abundance in this complex habitat type, and live high-relief oyster beds have been particularly difficult to sample with conventional gear. We used a quantitative sampling device to compare nekton use among high-relief live oyster reef, vegetated marsh edge Spartina alterniflora, and nonvegetated bottom habitat types. During 1 yr of seasonal sampling we collected 3791 fishes and 12 386 crustaceans representing 38 and 21 different species, respectively. Density and biomass of most fishes and crustaceans were significantly higher in oyster reef than over nonvegetated bottom. For benthic crustaceans, oyster reef supported a higher density and biomass than vegetated marsh edge. Nektonic crustaceans were generally more abundant in marsh edge than on oyster reef. Species composition and richness varied among habitat types and season; however, richness was highest in oyster reef, followed by marsh edge, and lowest on nonvegetated bottom, except during seasonal low densities during winter. Species composition and size differences were observed among habitat types. Our results show that oyster reef supports a high density, biomass, and richness of estuarine nekton in relation to typically examined estuarine habitat types and has the potential to be an essential habitat. Identifying and quantifying the role of oyster reefs will be critical to implementing effective management for essential fish habitat. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract = {The sex-role reversed pipefish Syngnathus typhle is a member of the Syngnathidae, a family of fishes in which males brood embryos on their body surface. As in most ectotherms, embryonic development is highly temperature dependent in syngnathids and male brooding periods are extended when water temperatures are reduced. The influence of temperature on reproduction is expected to effectively truncate the breeding season and reduce fecundity in cold waters, potentially enhancing the opportunity for both fecundity and sexual selection. We studied spatial variation in the morphology and reproductive biology of S. typhle in five European populations which vary in latitude and water temperature. Microsatellite analyses indicated that the average number of male mates per population ranged between 1.3 and 3.7. The frequency of multiple mating by males was negatively correlated with the degree of sexual size dimorphism in each population, suggesting that disproportionate increases in female fecundity may be able to compensate for increased male brood pouch capacity. Both sexes were larger and males had an increased brood size where water temperatures during the breeding season were lower. Morphological variation among populations may be mediated by differences in fecundity selection associated with different optimal reproductive strategies in cold and warm water environments.},

abstract = {Oysters have been introduced worldwide to 73 countries, but the eco- logical consequences of the introductions are not fully understood. Economically, introduced oysters compose a majority of oyster harvests in many areas. Oysters are ecosystem engineers that influence many ecological processes, such as maintenance of biodiversity, population and food web dynamics, and nutrient cycling. Consequently, both their loss, through interaction of overharvest, habitat degradation, disease, poor water quality, and detrimental species interactions, and their gain, through introduc- tions, can cause complex changes in coastal ecosystems. Introductions can greatly enhance oyster population abundance and production, as well as populations of as- sociated native species. However, introduced oysters are also vectors for non-native species, including disease-causing organisms. Thus, substantial population, commu- nity, and habitat changes have accompanied new oysters. In contrast, ecosystem-level consequences of oyster introductions, such as impacts on flow patterns, sediment and nutrient dynamics, and native bioengineering species, are not well understood. Eco- logical risk assessments for future introductions must emphasize probabilities of es- tablishment, spread, and impacts on vulnerable species, communities, and ecosystem properties. Many characteristics of oysters lead to predictions that they would be suc- cessful, high-impact members of recipient ecosystems. This conclusion leaves open the discussion of whether such impacts are desirable in terms of restoration of coastal ecosystems, especially where restoration of native oysters is possible.

ABSTRACT: Seston, particulate carbon, relative ir-radiance and Secchi disk depth measurements were taken at eight stations in the estuarine portion of the Patuxent River for two years. Seston values in the central portion of the estuary were high as a result of resuspension in the "sediment trap." In this estuary, seston concentration cannot be precisely estimated from either Secchi disk depth or the attenuation coefficient of diffuse light. The attenuation coefficient of diffuse light (k) may be calcu-lated from the equation: k = 1.43 [Secchi disk depth (m)]-'.},

abstract = {The simplest computational approach for estimating environmental carrying capacity (CC) for bivalve suspension-feeders is to compare the combined rate of filtration with rates of processes that contribute to food renewal. More realistic approaches are based on mathematical models that take into account complex sets of feedbacks, both positive and negative, whereby cultured organisms interact with ecosystem processes. Each of these methods requires spatial and temporal integrations. Yet densities of cultured animals and rates of ecological processes vary in space and time. We illustrate strong dependencies of estimated CC on the spatial and temporal scales chosen for associated integrations. Where food availability is the primary limitation upon CC, low resolution models may lead to overestimates of CC, when the potential for error increases in positive relation with the spatial scale resolved by a model. Considering both spatial and temporal integrations, we recommend a procedure to help evaluate the maximum appropriate scale for the situation at hand, thereby avoiding bias in estimates of CC stemming from any "dilution" of bivalve densities.},

We conducted two seasonal trials, each lasting 12 weeks, in autumn 2013 (n=54 cats) and spring 2014 (n=19 cats). Cats were randomly assigned to two groups, and CCs with interior collars were removed or put on every two weeks, to control for weather fluctuations and seasonal change. Cats wearing Birdsbesafe{\textregistered} CCs killed 19 times fewer birds than uncollared cats in the spring trial, and 3.4 times fewer birds in the fall. Birdsbesafe{\textregistered} CCs were extremely effective at reducing predation on birds. Small mammal data were less clear, but did decrease predation by half in the fall.

abstract = {Restoration ecology relies heavily on ecosystem development theories that generally assume development of fully functioning natural systems over time, but often fail to identify the time-frame required for provision of desired functions, or acknowledge different pathways of functional development. In estuaries, a decline of overall habitat quality and functioning has led to significant efforts to restore critical ecosystem services, recently through the creation and restoration of oyster reefs. Oyster reef restoration generally occurs with goals of (1) increasing water quality via filtration through sustainable oyster recruitment, (2) stabilizing shorelines, and (3) creating and enhancing critical estuarine habitat for fish and invertebrates. We restored over 260m2 of oyster reef habitat in coastal Louisiana and followed the development and provision of these ecosystem services from 2009 through 2012. Oysters recruited to reefs immediately, with densities of oysters greater than 75mm exceeding 80indm-2 after 3 years, and provision of filtration rates of 1002??187Lh-1m-2; shoreline stabilization effects of the created reefs were minimal over the three years of monitoring, with some evidence of positive shoreline stabilization during higher wind/energy events only; increased nekton abundance of resident, but not larger transient fish was immediately measurable at the reefs, however, this failed to increase through time. Our results provide critical insights into the development trajectories of ecosystem services provided by restored oyster reefs, as well as the mechanisms mediating these changes. This is critical both ecologically to understand how and where a reef thrives, and for policy and management to guide decision-making related to oyster reef restoration and the crediting and accounting of ecosystem services. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {The recent invasion of San Francisco Bay by the suspension-feeding clam Potamocorbula amurensis has provided an opportunity to document the ecological consequences of a major biological disturbance. Previous work over the last two decades has shown that phytoplankton biomass in the upper estuary is low (2-3 mg Chl a m-3) during seasonal periods of high river flow and short residence times, and it is usually high {\$}(peak{\textgreater}30 mg Chl a m{\^{}}-3){\$} during the summer-autumn seasons of low river flow and long residence time. However since P. amurensis became widespread and abundant in 1987, the summer phytoplankton biomass maximum has disappeared, presumably because of increased grazing pressure by this newly introduced species. For the period 1977-1990, mean estimated primary production was only 39 g C m-2 yr-1 during years when bivalve suspension feeders were abundant {\$}({\textgreater}2,000 m{\^{}}-2){\$} , compared to 106 g C m-2 yr-1 when bivalves were absent or present in low numbers. These observations support the hypothesis that seasonal and interannual fluctuations in estuarine phytoplankton biomass and primary production can be regulated jointly by direct physical effects (e. g. river-driven transport) and trophic interactions (episodes of enhanced grazing pressure by immigrant populations of benthic suspension feeders).},

abstract = {Geochemical environments were characterized for 14 sites along the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf and upper slope, in an effort to examine the relationship between sediment geochemistry and carbonate shell taphonomy in a long-term study-Shelf and Slope Experimental Taphonomy Initiative (SSETI). Three groups of environments of preservation (seep, near-seep, and shelf-and-slope) were identified based on their geochemical characteristics (i.e., oxygen uptake rate and penetration depth, pore-water saturation states, and carbonate dissolution fluxes). Diffusive oxygen uptake rate increased in the order of shelf-and-slope, near-seep, and seep, although carbonate dissolution flux did not show significant correlation with O 2 flux, presumably due to non-diffusive behavior at some sites. Using pore-water saturation indices with respect to aragonite and calcite and sedimentation rates, we defined a semi-quantitative parameter, carbonate dissolution index (CDI), to predict carbonate preservation potential during the taphonomic processes. Our limited database suggests that both the seep and the shelf-and-slope sediments may have higher carbonate preservation potential than the near-seep sediments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {SYNOPSIS. Intertidal suspension-feeding bivalves face reductions in the time available for feeding proportional to the duration of aerial exposure. Such individuals do not compensate by increasing their rates of feeding during immersion. Simulations of feeding behaviour, in terms of the energetic balance between the costs and the gains of changes in feeding rate, suggest that variation from the rates characteristic of the sublittoral condition would not enhance net energy gain for intertidal individuals. These findings are consistent with evidence of potential food limitation in the natural sublittoral habitat. Nevertheless, hydrodynamic factors may enhance the supply of food on the shore, so ameliorating the disadvantages of reduced feeding time. In addition, potential physiological compensations for reduced dietary quality include changes in gut residence time, the volume of gut occupied for digestion and (possibly) also in the provision of appropriate digestive enzymes. However, these compensations require days or weeks and are inappropriate on tidal time scales. {\textcopyright} 1988 by the American Society of Zoologists.},

However, the robustness of the oyster-DEB model needs to be validated in varying environments where different food quantifiers reflect the food available for oysters, as is the case in estuaries and most coastal ecosystems. We therefore tested the oyster-DEB model on C. gigas reared in an Atlantic coastal pond from January 2006 to January 2007. The model relies on two forcing variables: seawater temperature and food density monitored through various food quantifiers. Based on the high temperature range measured in this oyster pond (3-30????C), new boundary values of the temperature tolerance range were estimated both for ingestion and respiration rates. Several food quantifiers were then tested to select the most suitable for explaining the observed growth and reproduction of C. gigas reared in an oyster pond. These were: particulate organic matter and carbon, chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton enumeration (expressed in cell number per litre or in cumulative cell biovolume). We conclude that when phytoplankton enumeration was used as food quantifier, the new version of oyster-DEB model presented here reproduced the growth and reproduction of C. gigas very accurately. The next step will be to validate the model under contrasting coastal environmental conditions so as to confirm the accuracy of phytoplankton enumeration as a way of representing the available food that sustains oyster growth. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Many coastal habitat restoration projects are focused on restoring the population of a single foundation species to recover an entire ecological community. Estimates of the ecosystem services provided by the restoration project are used to justify, prioritize, and evaluate such projects. However, estimates of ecosystem services provided by a single species may vastly under-represent true provisioning, as we demonstrate here with an example of oyster reefs, often restored to improve estuarine water quality. In the brackish Chesapeake Bay, the hooked mussel Ischadium recurvum can have greater abundance and biomass than the focal restoration species, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. We measured the temperature-dependent phytoplankton clearance rates of both bivalves and their filtration efficiency on three size classes of phytoplankton to parameterize an annual model of oyster reef filtration, with and without hooked mussels, for monitored oyster reefs and restoration scenarios in the eastern Chesapeake Bay. The inclusion of filtration by hooked mussels increased the filtration capacity of the habitat greater than 2-fold. Hooked mussels were also twice as effective as oysters at filtering picoplankton (1.5-3 $\mu$m), indicating that they fill a distinct ecological niche by controlling phytoplankton in this size class, which makes up a significant proportion of the phytoplankton load in summer. When mussel and oyster filtration are accounted for in this, albeit simplistic, model, restoration of oyster reefs in a tributary scale restoration is predicted to control 100{\%} of phytoplankton during the summer months. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract = {In response to uncertainties about whether laboratory feeding rate measurements of bivalves reflect those occurring in situ, this study compares bivalve feeding rates experimentally determined both in the laboratory and in situ for a mussel (Mytilus chilensis) and a clam (Mulinia edulis), species exposed to a wide range of seston concentrations. Artificially prepared seston was administered in the laboratory using a mixture of Isochrysis galbana and sediment at concentrations ranging from 2 to 200 mg l-1. Field measurements were carried out at Yaldad Bay, southern Chile, during 2 tidal cycles in March and April 1999 with naturally occurring seston ranging from 3 to 665 mg l-1. We found that: (1) Clearance rate (CR) and selection efficiency (SE) were similar in laboratory and in situ conditions, but the rates of filtration (FR), ingestion (IR) and absorption (AR), and absorption efficiency (AE) were significantly higher in the laboratory than in the field. This was attributable to the greater retention efficiency and digestibility of I. galbana compared to the naturally occurring microalgae in the seston, and also to the greater acclimation time of specimens to the laboratory diet. (2) The responses to the changes in seston concentration (TPM) were similar under both conditions and validated previous results; CR decreased exponentially with increasing TPM while the FR, IR and AR increased. At high seston concentrations (200 mg l-1 in the laboratory and 665 mg l-1 in situ), almost all the feeding rates decreased, showing an impairment of food processing under these conditions. (3) The resuspended sediment in the intertidal zone of Yaldad Bay, especially under the influence of southerly winds and near the lowest tidal level, is an important food source for M. edulis and M. chilensis populations, allowing continued growth during the winter season when primary productivity is very low. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2005.},

abstract = {Physical-biological coupling helps structure aquatic communities, yet physical factors can vary widely across large, biogeographic scales. The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is an ecosystem engineer that creates intertidal reefs, filters water, promotes denitrification, stabilizes shorelines, and provides habitat throughout the inner waters of the U.S. South Atlantic Bight (SAB). We quantified physical variables (temperature, salinity, duration and depth of water inundation), oyster reef properties (slope, vertical relief), and oyster recruitment, density, and biomass over a 1500 km scale across the SAB for one year. All oyster-level and many reef-level variables exhibited unimodal patterns with latitude that peaked in Georgia and South Carolina estuaries. Of the physical variables, salinity and duration of water inundation over reefs were similar across all sites, and temperature declined linearly with increasing latitude, except during summer when it had no relationship with latitude. Depth of water inundation over reefs was the only physical variable with a prominent unimodal distribution that may explain the oyster's biological responses. Similar durations of water inundation across all reefs coupled with higher water depths in the mid-latitude sites collectively indicate that these sites experience higher flow velocity, energy and net water volume delivery per unit time. The resultant higher accumulation of oyster biomass and heightened reef structure in areas of higher tidal energy emphasize that the physical forcing of the SAB (especially large cross-shelf gradients in tidal amplification) affects the biology of the eastern oyster, including its reef properties, with potential implications for community structure and ecosystem service delivery across a biogeographic scale.},

abstract = {Oyster reefs provide myriad ecosystem services, including water quality improvement, fisheries and other faunal support, shoreline protection from erosion and storm surge, and economic productivity. However, their role in directing flow during non-storm conditions has been largely neglected. In regions where oyster reefs form near the mouth of estuarine rivers, they likely alter ocean-estuary exchange by acting as fresh water "dams". We hypothesize that these reefs have the potential to detain fresh water and influence salinity over extensive areas, thus providing a 'keystone" ecosystem service by supporting estuarine functions that rely on the maintenance of estuarine (i.e., brackish) conditions in the nearshore environment. In this work, we investigated the effects of shore-parallel reefs on estuarine salinity using field data and hydrodynamic modeling in a degraded reef complex in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Results suggested that freshwater detention by long linear chains of oyster reefs plays an important role in modulating salinities, not only in the oysters' local environment, but over extensive estuarine areas (tens of square kilometers). Field data confirmed the presence of salinity differences between landward and seaward sides of the reef, with long-term mean salinity differences of {\textgreater}30{\%} between sides. Modeled results expanded experimental findings by illustrating how oyster reefs affect the lateral and offshore extent of freshwater influence. In general, the effects of simulated reefs were most pronounced when they were highest in elevation, without gaps, and when riverine discharge was low. Taken together, these results describe a poorly documented ecosystem service provided by oyster reefs; provide an estimate of the magnitude and spatial extent of this service; and offer quantitative information to help guide future oyster reef restoration.},

abstract = {At a restored reef site and a control site in the Choptank River, Maryland, USA, we partially quantified the effect of oyster reef resto- ration on the removal of nutrients from the water column by determining seasonal fluxes of oxygen (O2), ammonium (NH4+), combined nitrate and nitrite (NO2+3), di-nitrogen (N2) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and by assessing the assimilation of nutrients by macrofauna. Fluxes of O2, NH4+, NO2+3 and SRP at the restored site were enhanced by at least one order of magnitude during all sea- sons. Seasonal denitrification rates at the restored site, measured as flux of N2-N, ranged from 0.3 to 1.6 mmol N2-N m−2 h−1, with August rates among the highest ever recorded for an aquatic system. In addition to oysters (131 oysters m−2; average shell height = 114 mm; age = 2 to 7 yr), the restored reef provided habitat for 24585 other macrobenthic organisms per square meter compared to 2265 or - ganisms m−2 at the control site. Restoration en - hanced the average standing stock of assimilated nutrients by 95 g N m−2 and 15 g P m−2. Nitrogen and phosphorus in shells of live oysters and mus- sels accounted for 47 and 48{\%} of total nitrogen and phosphorus standing stocks, respectively. Our results demonstrate that oyster reef restoration can significantly increase denitrification rates and enhance nutrient sequestration via assimilation into bivalve shells.},

abstract = {Abstract An intertidal Crassostrea virginica oyster reef was instrumented to quantify processes affecting boundary layer flow, suspended sediment deposition and erosion, and the flux of oxygen to and from the benthos. Velocity and suspended sediment concentrations were measured at opposing sides of the reef and sediment fluxes, due to the combined effects of deposition, resuspension, and suspension feeding by the reef community, were computed from the difference between upstreamand downstreamsuspended sediment concentrations. At the center of the reef, the flux of oxygen to and from the reef was measured using the eddy-correlation technique. While the reef was submerged, oxygen fluxes showed no significant correlation to light, and oxygen uptake increased linearly with velocity, ranging between 100 and 600mmolm-2d-1. Sediment deposition to the reef also increased linearly for velocities between 0 and 10cms-1, up to a maximum of 3500 gm-2d-1. For velocities .15cms-1, sediment flux to the reef decreased as sediment resuspension occurred due to bed shear stresses that exceeded the critical threshold for erosion. At velocities .25cms-1, there was net sediment erosion from the reef. Overall, during summertime and nonstorm conditions, mean oxygen uptake was 270 – 40mmolm-2d-1 and sediment deposition was 1100 – 390 gm-2d-1 while the reef was submerged, indicating that oysters have a net positive effect on water clarity and that hydrodynamics exert a strong influence on benthic fluxes of oxygen and sediment to and from the reef.

abstract = {The average pH of surface oceans has decreased by 0.1 unit since industrialization and is expected to decrease by another 0.3-0.7 units before the year 2300 due to the absorption of anthropogenic CO2. This human-caused pH change is posing serious threats and challenges to the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), especially to their larval stages. Our knowledge of the effect of reduced pH on C. gigas larvae presently relies presumptively on four short-term ({\textless}4 days) survival and growth studies. Using multiple physiological measurements and life stages, the effects of long-term (40 days) exposure to pH 8.1, 7.7 and 7.4 on larval shell growth, metamorphosis, respiration and filtration rates at the time of metamorphosis, along with the juvenile shell growth and structure of the C. gigas, were examined in this study. The mean survival and growth rates were not affected by pH. The metabolic, feeding and metamorphosis rates of pediveliger larvae were similar, between pH 8.1 and 7.7. The pediveligers at pH 7.4 showed reduced weight-specific metabolic and filtration rates, yet were able to sustain a more rapid post-settlement growth rate. However, no evidence suggested that low pH treatments resulted in alterations to the shell ultrastructures (SEM images) or elemental compositions (i.e., Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios). Thus, larval and post-larval forms of the C. gigas in the Yellow Sea are probably resistant to elevated CO2 and decreased near-future pH scenarios. The pre-adapted ability to resist a wide range of decreased pH may provide C. gigas with the necessary tolerance to withstand rapid pH changes over the coming century.},

abstract = {Food resources and water flow speeds vary on short-temporal and small-spatial scales important to feeding in natural populations of oysters (Crassostrea virginica). To better describe food availability to the oyster population, micro-current meters were used to measure flow 1-3 cm above the bottom and frequent water sampling was used to determine the quantity and composition of the seston on Confederate Reef, Galveston Bay, Texas. The quantity and quality of food varied on time scales at least as short as 3 h and throughout the water column. Seston was high in detrital carbon, nitrogen poor, and had a high fraction of inorganic particles. The quantity of food at the bed was not predictable from samples taken near the surface. Water flow speeds were also highly variable. Whereas rapid flow speeds were measured, flow speed tended to cluster about a narrower range of slower speeds resulting in the mean speed being much higher than the median. Fluxes of food calculated from the quantity of food and water flow speeds were low and highly variable. Under most conditions, water flow speed was more important than food quantity in determining flux. Rapid flow rates could overcome low food quantity to result in relatively high fluxes, whereas slow flow resulted in small fluxes even if food was abundant. Changes in water flow rate associated with tidal changes and changes in speed are probably the primary agents controlling food availability on a daily basis. Decreased wind speed at night normally reduced flux in the early morning hours, for example. These results stress the importance of measuring food quantity and water flow speed on spatial and temporal scales important to oyster feeding. Model simulations of oyster populations at varying densities, flow rates and clump heights across the range of measured values show that flow rate is insufficient during most hours of the day and days of the year to prevent oysters from locally reducing food supply by their filtering efforts. Thus flow rate probably limits population density and adult size on Confederate Reef.},

abstract = {Modes of colonization, the successional trajectory, and trophic recovery of a macrofaunal community were analyzed over 19 months in the Friendship marsh, a 20-acre restored wetland in Tijuana Estuary, California. Traditional techniques for quantifying macrofaunal communities were combined with emerging stable isotopic approaches for evaluation of trophic recovery, making comparisons with a nearby natural Spartina foliosa habitat. Life history-based predictions successfully identified major colonization modes, although most taxa employed a variety of tactics for colonizing the restored marsh. The presence of S. foliosa did not seem to affect macrofaunal colonization or succession at the scale of this study. However, soil organic matter content in the restored marsh was positively correlated with insect densities, and high initial salinities may have limited the success of early colonists. Total macrofaunal densities recovered to natural marsh levels after 14 months and diversity, measured as species richness and the Shannon index (H′), was comparable to the natural marsh by 19 months. Some compositional disparities between the natural and created communities persisted after 19 months, including lower percentages of surface-feeding polychaetes (Polydora spp.) and higher percentages of dipteran insects and turbellarians in the Friendship marsh. As surficial structural similarity of infaunal communities between the Friendship and natural habitat was achieved, isotopic analyses revealed a simultaneous trajectory towards recovery of trophic structure. Enriched $\delta$13C signatures of benthic microalgae and infauna, observed in the restored marsh shortly after establishment compared to natural Spartina habitat, recovered after 19 months. However, the depletion in $\delta$15N signatures of macrofauna in the Friendship marsh indicated consumption of microalgae, particularly nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, while macroalgae and Spartina made a larger contribution to macrofaunal diets in the natural habitat. Future successional studies must continue to develop and employ novel combinations of techniques for evaluating structural and functional recovery of disturbed and created habitats. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {At least 160 species in 11 phyla of marine and estuarine invertebrates have either certainly or probably been introduced by man into the bays, estuaries, and harbors of the Pacific coast of North America from southern Alaska to northern Baja California. These species have been introduced since the mid-nineteenth century primarily on and in ships (as fouling, boring, and ballast dwelling organisms) and with commercial oyster transplantations. Major donor areas of this introduced fauna are the western and southwestern Pacific Ocean and the western Atlantic Ocean. A positive relationship between the intensity of shipping or oyster introductions and the introduction of exotic species may exist, such that multiple and massive inoculations may trigger the successful establishment of a foreign species. A detailed set of criteria, centering upon evidence derived from systematics, biogeography, history, distributional ecology, biology, and genetics, is set forth for the recognition of introduced species. From the Straits of Georgia to Coos Bay, Oregon, the exotic fauna is comprised largely of estuarine species introduced with oysters (and/or shipping) from the North Atlantic Ocean and from the western North Pacific Ocean; a strictly ship-fouling exotic fauna is poorly represented here; from Humboldt Bay to Morro Bay, but primarily concentrated in San Francisco Bay, the exotic fauna is represented relatively equally by estuarine species derived from ship-fouling and ballast, oysters, and oysters and/or shipping. These originate predominately from the Atlantic, and less so from the western Pacific. A small introduced warm-water southern faunal element is established on the margins of San Francisco Bay. In arid southern California embayments and harbors, stenohaline exotic fouling species introduced primarily by ships are derived largely from the Atlantic and less so from the western Pacific; a strong representation of southern hemisphere warm-water species exists here. With few exceptions, the introduced invertebrates of the Pacific coast are restricted to protected calm-water embayments, estuaries, and harbors. Hypotheses to account for this restriction relate to the absence of mechanisms that would transport open-coast species from other regions of the world to the Pacific coast, and to the failure of exotic species to spread to the open coast for biological, physiological, and ecological (competitive) reasons. Introduced species form distinctive communities on the Pacific coast. In some bays and harbors exotic species are dominant in both species numbers and in biomass. Their successful establishment may be related to (1) the hypothetical absence of competitive interactions, due to the lack of native ecologically equivalent species (aboriginally absent or destroyed by man), and/or due to the creation of novel habitats by man to which only certain introduced species were preadapted, and to (2) the possible competitive displacement of some native species by invading exotic species. The transport by man of invertebrates has contributed significantly to a world-wide similarity in estuarine and harbor faunas, of which the introduced fauna of the northeastern Pacific Ocean is a striking example. Community studies that embrace not only the introduced invertebrates of the Pacific coast, but also the exotic species of fish, algae, and seagrasses that are now present, will yield a synthetic picture of the extent to which man, through accidental introductions, has modified the nearshore fauna.},

abstract = {The Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, is the only oyster native to the west coast of N. America. Once abundant, O. lurida is now considered functionally extinct and absence of Olympia oysters has contributed to a continual decline in the health of California's valuable estuary ecosystems. Human-assisted reintroduction is one potential strategy to increase O. lurida population sizes and help restore Californian estuaries. Ideally, restoration would use genotypes capable of surviving future conditions. However, which O. lurida populations will be most tolerant of climate change, in particular low salinity, and therefore most suitable for use in reintroduction remains uncertain. RNA-Seq has emerged as a vital tool to understand ecological and evolutionary processes of non-model organisms. Using a novel RNA-Seq pipeline, a transcriptome for O. lurida was generated yielding 51,574 contigs and accounting for upwards of 10,000 unique genes. Quality control metrics including mean contig length (1664 bp), percent of reads mapped back to the reference transcriptome (78{\%}), and the percent of annotated reads (49{\%}), are similar to other non-model organism transcriptome assemblies, and offers a substantial improvement over existing sequence resources for O. lurida. In important future research, this transcriptome can be used to better understand how O. lurida populations manage environmental stress at the molecular level and help to identify which populations of O. lurida are ultimately best suited for reintroduction.},

abstract = {Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide drive accompanying changes in the marine carbonate system as carbon dioxide (CO2) enters seawater and alters ocean pH (termed “ocean acidification”). However, such changes do not occur in isolation, and other environmental factors have the potential to modulate the consequences of altered ocean chemistry. Given that physiological mechanisms used by or- ganisms to confront acidification can be energetically costly, we explored the potential for food supply to influence the response of Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) larvae to ocean acidification. In laboratory experiments, we reared oyster lar- vae under a factorial combination of pCO2 and food level. Elevated pCO2 had negative effects on larval growth, total dry weight, and metamorphic success, but high food avail- ability partially offset these influences. The combination of elevated pCO2 and low food availability led to the great- est reduction in larval performance. However, the effects of food and pCO2 interacted additively rather than synergisti- cally, indicating that they operated independently. Despite the potential for abundant resources to counteract the con- sequences of ocean acidification, impacts were never com- pletely negated, suggesting that even under conditions of en- hanced primary production and elevated food availability, impacts of ocean acidification may still accrue in some con- sumers.},

abstract = {Predicting impacts of global environmental change is challenging due to the complex life cycles that characterize many terrestrial and aquatic taxa. Different life stages often interact with the physical environment in distinct ways, and a growing body of work suggests that stresses experienced during one life stage can "carry over" to influence subsequent stages. Assessments of population responses to environmental perturbation must therefore consider how effects might propagate across life-history transitions. We investigated consequences of ocean acidification (decreased pH and carbonate saturation) for early life stages of the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida), a foundation species in estuaries along the Pacific coast of North America. We reared oysters at three levels of seawater pH, including a control (8.0) and two additional levels (7.9 and 7.8). Oysters were cultured through their planktonic larval period to metamorphosis and into early juvenile life. Larvae reared under pH 7.8 exhibited a 15{\%} decrease in larval shell growth rate, and a 7{\%} decrease in shell area at settlement, compared to larvae reared under control conditions. Impacts were even more pronounced a week after settlement, with juveniles that had been reared as larvae under reduced pH exhibiting a 41{\%} decrease in shell growth rate. Importantly, the latter effect arose regardless of the pH level the oysters experienced as juveniles, indicating a strong carry-over effect from the larval phase. Adverse impacts of early exposure to low pH persisted for at least 1.5 months after juveniles were transferred to a common environment. Overall, our results suggest that a stringent focus on a single phase of the life cycle (e.g., one perceived as the "weakest link") may neglect critical impacts that can be transferred across life stages in taxa with complex life histories.},

The highest correlation coefficient was obtained in Artificial Neural Network architecture (R = 0.997). According to the three data mining methods, the global radiation was found as the most important predictor.

abstract = {Many coastal habitat restoration projects are focused on restoring the population of a single foundation species to recover an entire ecological community. Estimates of the ecosystem services provided by the restoration project are used to justify, prioritize, and evaluate such projects. However, estimates of ecosystem services provided by a single species may vastly under-represent true provisioning, as we demonstrate here with an example of oyster reefs, often restored to improve estuarine water quality. In the brackish Chesapeake Bay, the hooked mussel Ischadium recurvum can have greater abundance and biomass than the focal restoration species, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. We measured the temperature-dependent phytoplankton clearance rates of both bivalves and their filtration efficiency on three size classes of phytoplankton to parameterize an annual model of oyster reef filtration, with and without hooked mussels, for monitored oyster reefs and restoration scenarios in the eastern Chesapeake Bay. The inclusion of filtration by hooked mussels increased the filtration capacity of the habitat greater than 2-fold. Hooked mussels were also twice as effective as oysters at filtering picoplankton (1.5-3 $\mu$m), indicating that they fill a distinct ecological niche by controlling phytoplankton in this size class, which makes up a significant proportion of the phytoplankton load in summer. When mussel and oyster filtration are accounted for in this, albeit simplistic, model, restoration of oyster reefs in a tributary scale restoration is predicted to control 100{\%} of phytoplankton during the summer months. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

In a companion study, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis was shown to graze on both micro- and mesozooplankton causing depletion above the mussel bed (Nielsen {\&} Maar, Mar Ecol Prog Ser 339:185-198). However, the vertical zooplankton distribution varied between sampling days, and we thus examined the influence of turbulence on the escape capability of different zooplankton organisms. Two sampling days were selected for further analysis representing relatively low ($\epsilon$ ≈ 10-7 m2 s-3) and high ($\epsilon$ ≈ 10-6 m 2 s-3) near-bed turbulence (estimated by a physical water column model, General Ocean Turbulence Model, GOTM). The grazing impact on the zooplankton was estimated by a random walk model taking zooplankton motility and escape behaviour into account as well as turbulence conditions. Protozooplankton and bivalve larvae were always captured efficiently by mussels irrespective of turbulence conditions, while the grazing impact on nauplii and copepodites was greatly reduced due to increased escape success in low turbulence conditions. Thus, the zooplankton community will be more diverse during low turbulence conditions and will compete with mussels for phytoplankton food. Seasonal importance of the different components of the pelagic food web for mussel consumption was evaluated by comparing the model results with plankton data from the studied fjord system. The analysis stresses the need, when evaluating the ecological role of mussels, to also consider the heterotrophic components of the food web. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract = {Oyster reefs provide an array of ecosystem services. Specifically, they provide structurally complex habitat for fish and invertebrate species such as the commercially important Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister. This ecosystem service, once provided by the native oyster Ostrea lurida, is now provided by the commercially cultured oyster Crassostrea gigas in many estuaries on the U.S west coast. An economic investigation was conducted examining the ecosystem services provided by oyster habitat, common economic valuation theories and techniques, and tradeoffs between oyster restoration and aquaculture expansion. A scientific investigation, comprised of three studies, was also conducted to examine Dungeness crab production as an ecosystem service provided by oyster habitat. Because natural ecosystems, such as oyster reefs, provide beneficial goods and services through time, they should be valued as any other economic asset or capital. Until recently many of these beneficial services have not been accounted for within resource management plans, often resulting in the over-exploitation of those resources. Activities such as coastal development, dredging, aquaculture expansion, or even habitat restoration can affect estuarine ecosystems. While valuing the ecosystems themselves might be difficult, valuation of the services they provide can be a useful tool for identifying and protecting key ecosystem services while implementing plans with minimal negative impact. The oysters, O. lurida and C. gigas inhabit different regions of the tidal zone. O. lurida is predominantly found in subtidal and low intertidal regions whereas C. gigas is predominantly found in intertidal regions. The shift in the dominant species has resulted in a subsequent shift of available recruitment habitat for M. magister. We conducted an across-estuary study to examine settlement of M. magister in existing O. lurida, C. gigas, eelgrass, and open mud habitats in Willapa Bay, WA, Netarts Bay, OR, and Coos Bay, OR, to determine tradeoffs in crab production between habitat types. A second study using shell bags as settlement substrate at various tidal elevations was conducted in Yaquina Bay, OR, to obtain density data of M. magister by depth. We used these densities, in combination with pre-existing data from Willapa Bay, to compare the production of Dungeness crab as an ecosystem service historically provided by O. lurida habitat and production currently provided by C. gigas habitat in Willapa Bay, WA. A third study using shell piles was conducted in Yaquina Bay, OR to estimate survival of juvenile M. magister. The results of these three studies generally support prior research indicating that densities of juvenile M. magister are greater in oyster and eelgrass habitats than in open mud, and are generally greater in oyster habitat than in eelgrass. The Yaquina Bay shell bag study indicated greater densities of juvenile M. magister in subtidal regions, while the shell pile study indicated greater densities in higher intertidal regions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Seston utilization by adult Mytilus edulis and Placopecten magellanicus cohorts was measured using an in situ method over a total period of 139 d during the spring, summer and fall of 1995 in Bedford Basin and Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada. Daily seston utilization measurements were combined with extensive water sampling to construct predictive empirical models of bivalve ingestion based on environmental variables. Particle concentrations were highest in May in Bedford Basin ({\~{}}5 mg l-1) and remained below 2 mg l-1 in Mahone Bay. Seston quality during the study varied between 30 (summer) and 90{\%} (spring) organic content. Large seasonal changes in the rates and efficiencies of feeding and absorption were observed, but only 28{\%} of the variance in daily ingestion rates of both species could be explained by a wide range of potential environmental influences (temperature, seston abundance and composition and vertical particle flux). Ingestion and absorption rates of scallops and mussels were highest during the spring, when diet quantity and quality were high, and during late autumn, when quantity and quality were low. These data indicate that changes in seston utilization and related growth were not caused solely by seasonal food and temperature fluctuations, but imply physiological regulation of feeding and digestion. Both species displayed a large capacity for controlling clearance and absorption rates. Clearance rates during October and November were at least twice as high as observed at other times of the year, and absorption efficiency gradually decreased at high diet quality and increased when quality was low. Temporal variations in food utilization by both species may be explained by the combined constraints on maximizing net energy gain of relatively low food availability and the seasonally changing energy demands of reproduction. The accuracy of various bivalve clearance (filtration) rate models was assessed by comparing predicted responses with average in situ clearance rate estimates. Only those models based on natural seston rations provided adequate predictions of observed clearance behaviour. Clearance rate predictions based on algal cell rations greatly overestimated in situ clearance at all times of the year and appear to be of limited application for predicting feeding activity in nature. Current theories on the ecological role of bivalve communities in coastal regions are questionable as they commonly depend on the assumption that clearance capacity is fully exploited.},

abstract = {Recruitment of new propagules into a population can be a critical determinant of adult density. We examined recruitment dynamics in the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida), a species occurring almost entirely in estuaries. We investigated spatial scales of interannual synchrony across 37 sites in eight estuaries along 2,500 km of Pacific North American coastline, predicting that high vs. low recruitment years would coincide among neighboring estuaries due to shared exposure to regional oceanographic factors. Such synchrony in recruitment has been found for many marine species and some migratory estuarine species, but has never been examined across estuaries in a species that can complete its entire life cycle within the same estuary. To inform ongoing restoration efforts for Olympia oysters, which have declined in abundance in many estuaries, we also investigated predictors of recruitment failure. We found striking contrasts in absolute recruitment rate and frequency of recruitment failure among sites, estuaries, and years. Although we found a positive relationship between upwelling and recruitment, there was little evidence of synchrony in recruitment among estuaries along the coast, and only limited synchrony of sites within estuaries, suggesting recruitment rates are affected more strongly by local dynamics within estuaries than by regional oceanographic factors operating at scales encompassing multiple estuaries. This highlights the importance of local wetland and watershed management for the demography of oysters, and perhaps other species that can complete their entire life cycle within estuaries. Estuaries with more homogeneous environmental conditions had greater synchrony among sites, and this led to the potential for estuary-wide failure when all sites had no recruitment in the same year. Environmental heterogeneity within estuaries may thus buffer against estuary-wide recruitment failure, analogous to the portfolio effect for diversity. Recruitment failure was correlated with lower summer water temperature, higher winter salinity, and shorter residence time: all indicators of stronger marine influence on estuaries. Recruitment failure was also more common in estuaries with limited networks of nearby adult oysters. Large existing oyster networks are thus of high conservation value, while estuaries that lack them would benefit from restoration efforts to increase the extent and connectivity of sites supporting oysters.},

abstract = {The Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida Carpenter, was formerly widespread in many US Pacific coast estuaries. Following dramatic declines in the late 1800s and early 1900s, this species is now the focus of renewed restoration efforts. Restoration is undertaken for brood stock rehabilitation as well as a range of ecosystem services such as filtration; however, these ecosystem services are as yet poorly quantified. We present the first laboratory measurements of filtration rates (FR) for O. lurida, to which we fit a model of FR as a function of dry tissue weight and water temperature. We find that O. lurida has a FR at optimum temperature similar to previously established means across oyster species at 1 g dry tissue weight (DTW), but lower than many Crassostrea species. We also find that the allometric exponent relating FR to DTW in O. lurida is lower than the previously published mean across oyster species. Based on our derived filtration rates and historical data, we estimate the historic impact of filtration by O. lurida in five Pacific coast estuaries. We find that historic O. lurida populations did not have the capacity to filter the full volume of the estuary within the estuary residence time in any of the estuaries examined. This result is primarily driven by the low water temperatures and the short estuary residence times that typify the Pacific coast. We conclude that, unlike Crassostrea virginica Gmelin on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, the Olympia oyster was not historically a dominant force in regulating seston concentrations at large scales in Pacific coast estuaries. Given the differences in the ecological role and habitat structure of these two oyster species, we recommend that analogies between them be drawn with caution. We discuss the implications of our results for developing restoration objectives.},

Some changes will result in hybrid systems retaining some original characteristics as well as novel elements, whereas larger changes will result in novel systems, which comprise different species, interactions and functions.

Forecasted accelerations in sea-level rise (SLR) will shift the position of these critical boundaries in ways we cannot yet fully predict, but landward migration will be impaired by coastal development, amplifying the importance of foundation speciesa ability to maintain their position relative to rising sea levels via vertical growth. Here we show the effects of emergence on vertical oyster-reef growth by determining the conditions at which intertidal reefs thrive and the sharp boundaries where reefs fail, which shift with changes in sea level. We found that oyster reef growth is unimodal relative to emergence, with greatest growth rates occurring between 20-40{\%} exposure, and zero-growth boundaries at 10{\%} and 55{\%} exposures. Notably, along the lower growth boundary (10{\%}), increased rates of SLR would outpace reef accretion, thereby reducing the depth range of substrate suitable for reef maintenance and formation, and exacerbating habitat loss along developed shorelines. Our results identify where, within intertidal areas, constructed or natural oyster reefs will persist and function best as green infrastructure to enhance coastal resiliency under conditions of accelerating SLR.},

abstract = {Suspension-feeding eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, were once abundant in Chesapeake Bay and may then have exerted top-down control on phytoplankton and also reduced turbidities, thereby increasing light available to benthic plants. Alternatively, oysters may have simply recycled inorganic nutrients rapidly back to the water column, with no long-lasting reduction in phytoplankton biomass resulting from oyster feeding activity. To help distinguish between these scenarios, we explored changes in nitrogen fluxes and denitrification in laboratory incubations of sediment cores held under oxic and anoxic conditions in response to loading by pelletized phytoplankton cells, an experimental analog for oyster feces and pseudofeces. When organics were regenerated under aerobic conditions, typical of those associated with oyster habitat, coupled nitrification-denitrification was promoted, resulting in denitrification of similar to20{\%} of the total added nitrogen. In contrast, under anoxic conditions, typical of current summertime conditions in main-stem Chesapeake Bay where phytoplankton is microbially degraded beneath the pycnocline, nitrogen was released solely as ammonium from the added organics. We postulate that denitrification of particulate nitrogen remaining in oyster feces and pseudofeces may enhance nitrogen removal from estuaries. In aerobic incubations with sufficient light (70 mumol m(-2) s(-1)), a benthic microalgal/cyanobacterial community grew that not only absorbed the inorganic nitrogen released from the added organics but also fixed N-2. This result suggests that an ecosystem dominated by benthic primary production may develop in shallow waters when reduced turbidity associated with bivalve feeding increases light penetration to a level that can sustain benthic microalgal production.},

abstract = {Using an artificial diet, composed of silt {\textless} 32 p in diameter and the alga Tetraselmis suecica, it was demonstrated that the oyster Crassostrea virginica could significantly reduce the concentration of algae voided in the pseudofaeces (measured as extracted chlorophyll pigment) by over 50 {\%}, compared to levels in the food. More importantly, it was also shown that for C. virginica fed natural seston at concentrations between 4 to 20 mg I-', the proportion of energy, carbon and nitrogen voided in the pseudofaeces could also be reduced significantly compared to that in the food. As the organic material in natural seston is from a wide range of sources -e.g. phytoplankton of different sizes, bacteria, detritus particles, etc. -these results indicate that C. virginica has a well developed ability to ingest preferentially various types of organic material and to reject other particles as pseudofaeces. This discriminatory mechanism must be able to operate on individual particles despite the fact that they are bound in viscous mucus. We hypothesise (based on literature information for the properties of molluscan mucus) that the viscosity of the mucus in which the food particles are entrapped may be significantly reduced by the ciliary action on the ridged surfaces of the opposed labial palps. This reduced viscosity mucus is possibly moved to the free edge of the palp where, with a cessation of the mechanical stimulation, it regains its original viscosity. The individual particles may then be subject to chemical testing by chemoreceptors which determine whether a particle is moved over the palp ridge to the mouth or is admitted to the deep rejection tracts. These rejected particles move to the free edge of the palps where they are re-incorporated in the mucus and rejected as pseudofaeces.},

abstract = {As coastal catchment land use intensifies, estuaries receive increased nutrient and sediment loads, resulting in habitats that are dominated by muddy organic-rich sediments. Increased mud (i.e. silt-clay (particles {\textless} 63 $\mu$m)) content has been associated with negative effects on soft sediment biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but the simultaneous impact of nutrient enrichment on ecosystem response is unclear. Nutrient recycling and denitrification in estuarine soft sediments represent important ecosystem functions regenerating nutrients for primary producers and regulating the ability to remove excess terrestrially derived nitrogen. To test the effect of sedimentary environment on ecosystem resilience to nutrient perturbation, we experimentally enriched sediments with slow release fertiliser across an intertidal sedimentary gradient (0–24{\%} mud content). The enrichment successfully elevated pore water ammonium concentrations (median 36 × control) to levels representative of enriched estuaries. Findings show that the sedimentary environment can influence ecosystem function response to nutrient stress. In particular, denitrification enzyme activity was suppressed by nutrient enrichment, but the effect was greater as sediment mud content increased. Furthermore, compared with sandy sediments, sediments with high mud content may restrict nutrient processing (release, uptake or transformation of organic nutrients by the benthos) facilitating ecosystem shifts toward eutrophication. These results show the value of investigating the impacts ofstressors in different environmental settings and demonstrate that land use practices that increase the proportion ofmuddy habitats in estuaries may reduce denitrification which in turn may reduce ecosystem resilience to eutrophication.},

abstract = {The most commonly used methods for measuring the amount of seston removed from the water column (uptake) by populations of suspension-feeding bivalve molluscs involve taking discrete water samples followed by laboratory analyses. Here we describe a new method based on in situ fluorometry that provides rapid measurement of seston removal rates. The new system is comprised of two identical units, each consisting of an in situ fluorometer, data logger and peristaltic pump with plastic tube attached to a deployment device. The deployment device allows precise placement of the fluorometer probe and intake end of the plastic tube so that in situ fluorescence (chlorophyll a) can be measured and water can be sampled for seston analyses in the laboratory from the same height. The typical setup involves placing one unit upstream and the other downstream of the study area and sampling the water at periodic intervals. Changes in seston concentration are revealed in the field by the fluorometers, and the sampled water can be analyzed in the laboratory for various seston parameters. Comparisons of the in situ data with data from laboratory analyses of pumped water samples were made for three species at four study sites: the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria), and blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). Comparisons of measured upstream versus downstream seston concentrations indicated significant (t-tests, P {\textless} 0.05) differences (uptake) for six of eight trials based on in situ fluorometry, but only marginally significant (P {\textless} 0.10) differences at two of the four trials using laboratory chlorophyll a measurements. These data demonstrate that compared with sampling methods requiring laboratory analyses, the new in situ method provides much more rapid quantitative assessments and may provide more accurate estimates.},

abstract = {Seston in salt marshes contains a temporally and spatially complex mixture of natural microparticulate organic material, including phytoplankton, vascular plant detritus, bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates and benthic diatoms. Quantitative information is available concerning how suspension-feeding consumers, such as the ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa (Dillwyn), utilize some of these components to satisfy their carbon demands. Despite this information there is still a limited understanding of how the relative nutritive contribution of these different dietary items may shift during the year associated with variations in both seston composition and the mussel's physiological condition. To investigate if the mussel's ability to use specific constituents of natural seston varies seasonally, we ran a series of pulse-chase 14C feeding experiments under ambient conditions in March, May, August and November 1996. Phytoplankton, cellulosic detritus, bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates and benthic diatoms were radiolabeled and supplemented in small amounts to natural marsh water for feeding to mussels. The fate of 14C in mussel tissues, feces, respiration and excretion was quantified and contrasted among the different diet types and seasons. Microcapsules containing radiolabeled carbohydrate and protein were used as standards to differentiate possible between-experiment variations in seston composition from seasonal changes in the mussel's feeding and digestive physiology. Mussel clearance rates for all diets were highest in summer and autumn and lowest in winter and spring. In contrast, seasonal shifts in digestive physiology were only found for certain diets. The seasonal range of assimilation efficiencies for microcapsule standards (18-29{\%}) and field-collected microheterotrophs (bacteria 76-93{\%} and heterotrophic nanoflagellates 87-94{\%}) did not differ significantly during the year, whereas summer and autumn assimilation efficiencies for cellulosic detritus (22-24{\%}), phytoplankton (71-79{\%}) and benthic diatoms (89-93{\%}) were up to twofold greater than those in winter and spring (13{\%}, 40-59{\%} and 45-81{\%}, respectively). We conclude that the digestive physiology (e.g., digestive enzyme production) of mussels responds to shifts in dietary components during the year. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The capacity of filter feeders to reduce seston and phytoplankton concentrations in the water column has important implications for restoration and management of coastal ecosystems. We directly measured changes in chlorophyll a concentration on commercially stocked intertidal oyster beds (Crassostrea gigas) in Willapa Bay, Washington, USA by recording water properties near small drifters as they tracked parcels of water across tide flats. Chlorophyll declined 9.6{\%} per half hour in water passing on-bottom adult oysters and 41{\%} for longline adult oysters, whereas chlorophyll concentrations increased as water flowed across tide flats without adult oysters. Field filtration rates, which were fit to exponential declines in chlorophyll and accounted for oyster density and water depth, averaged 0.35Lg-1h-1 (shucked dry weight) for on-bottom aquaculture and 0.73Lg-1h-1 for longline culture, compared to values of 2.5-12Lg-1h-1 reported from laboratory studies of C. gigas. Field filtration rates may be lower than laboratory rates due to unfavorable field conditions (e.g., low initial chlorophyll concentrations) or masked by resuspension of benthic microalgae. In addition to distinctions among on-bottom, longline, and no-oyster habitats, Akaike's Information Criterion analysis showed temperature, initial chlorophyll concentration, and depth related to chlorophyll decline. This research corroborates mathematical models suggesting that benthic suspension feeders are exerting top-down control of pelagic production in this estuary, with strong patterns in chlorophyll emerging across extensive tideflats populated by C. gigas despite low field filtration rates. ?? 2013.},

This material is the potential food resource for suspension-feeding ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa, that inhabit the marsh intertidal zone. For eight tidal cycles each season we collected water six times at hourly intervals from mid-flood tide to mid-ebb tide. Although the concentration of seston did not vary seasonally, there were significant seasonal variations (analysis of variance, P {\textless} 0.05) in seston components, with chlorophyll a concentration being highest in May and bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates most abundant in August. Seston composition also varied within each tidal cycle with a magnitude as great as the seasonal variation. We conclude that ribbed mussels are subject to an unpredictable food supply that varies in composition and concentration on the order of hours and days. In contrast to the pronounced temporal changes, seston characteristics did not differ significantly among sampling locations within the marsh, or between samples collected close to the sediment surface and from the upper water column. Resuspension of sediment particles caused by tidal flow was not evident in tidal creeks and there were no dominant patterns in total seston concentration corresponding to tidal stages (flood tide, high slack water, and ebb tide) over the five sampling months. The abundance of biological components in the seston, including chlorophyll a, bacteria, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, were significantly greater during high flood tide and high slack water than during ebb tide. The decline of biological components, particularly chlorophyll a in the ebb tide, indicates that this temperate saltmarsh imported organic material produced in the Delaware estuary. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {ABSTRACT The continued lack of recovery of the United States west coast populations of the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida† Carpenter 1864, has piqued recent interest in restoration projects. Because local population persistence is influenced by many factors, including larval settlement, information about the magnitude and timing of settlement will provide valuable contributions to such restoration efforts.Weexamined larval settlement as a function of season and also monitored water temperature, which is reported to influence settlement timing by cueing synchronized male spawning and subsequent larval settlement. Previous literature, based on an anomalous open coast population, found that settlement of O. lurida in La Jolla, CA occurred once seawater reached a temperature of 16?C. To observe variation over seasons in larval settlement density relative to temperature within the more common estuarine habitat in southern California, we placed ceramic tiles in two locations within Upper Newport Bay, Newport, California and in two locations within Aqua Hedionda Lagoon, Carlsbad, California. Temperature data were also collected at each site throughout the sampling period. Tiles were collected and oyster spat counted every two weeks during spring tides to pinpoint pulses in settlement. Settlement in Upper Newport Bay occurred fromMayuntil November with peak settlement in June and ranged from 0.0 oysters/m2 to 1,179 ± 344.8 oysters/m2 at Coney Island and 0.0 oysters/m2 to 511 ± 216.4 oysters/m2 at Newport Wall. In Aqua Hedionda Lagoon, settlement occurred from June until February with peak settlement in June and ranged from 0.0 oysters/m2 to 339 ± 53.7 oysters/m2 at Aqua Hedionda site 1 and 0.0 oysters/m2 to 108 ± 37.3 oysters/m2 at Aqua Hedionda site 2. Whereas oyster settlement did occur at all of our study sites, we did not observe a universal temperature that correlated with the initiation and termination of oyster settlement, nor any significant correlations linking water temperature with peaks in settlement},

abstract = {It has recently been hypothesized that intertidal mussel beds and seaweed canopies in the Gulf of Maine are alternate community stable states or disturbance patch mosaics dominated by either seaweed or mussel communities. The community that occurs in a given site is proposed to be stochastic and dependent on the size of the original disturbance and subsequent recruit availability. Large disturbances are postulated to be dominated by mussel beds and barnacles with widely dispersed larvae, whereas smaller disturbances are dominated by seaweeds, with limited dispersal. Positive feedbacks are proposed to maintain these two communities. We tested this hypothesis in a tidal estuary in central Maine. At eight mussel bed and eight seaweed canopy sites, we created 9-m2 and 1-m2 clearings and an unmanipulated control area, and in each plot established control, caged, and cage control quadrats. After three years of monitoring, our results do not support the alternate stable state hypothesis. Instead, they suggest that the occurrence of mussel beds and seaweed canopies is highly deterministic. Seaweed canopies dominate habitats with relatively little water movement, whereas mussel beds dominate habitats with high flows; and largely independent of disturbance size, mussel beds and seaweed canopies rapidly returned to their original community type, but only in the absence of consumers (crabs and snails). With consumers present, neither community showed significant signs of recovery, even after three years. In the presence of consumers, community recovery appears to be dependent on cracks and crevices providing refuges from consumers to seaweed and mussel recruits. The idea that natural communities may represent stochastically determined alternate stable states has important implications for understanding and managing natural ecosystems, but the very existence of alternate stable states in nature has been difficult to establish. Our results suggest that intertidal seaweed canopies and mussel beds in tidal rivers in the Gulf of Maine are highly deterministic alternative community states under consumer control. More generally, since all proposed examples of alternate community stable states are based on indirect, inferential evidence, our results imply that stochastically determined alternate community stable states might be an interesting theoretical idea without a definitive empirical example.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic pressures on the marine environment have escalated and shellfish habitats have declined substantially around the world. Recently, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have rapidly increased in number, but management baselines rarely account for historical conditions. Marine examples of habitat restoration are therefore unusual. An interdisciplinary review of management baselines was undertaken for the Dornoch Firth protected area (NE Scotland) as well as three adjacent inlets and 50 km of open coastline. The protected area has low levels of industrial development, is sparsely populated, and previously achieved management objectives. Here we systematically searched for historical evidence of native oyster (Ostrea edulis) beds, a habitat now rare and of conservation importance throughout Atlantic Europe. Archaeological records, navigational charts, historical maps, museum collections, land-use records, fisheries records, public online databases and naturalists' records were searched. We conducted intertidal and subtidal surveys and sample oyster shells were radiocarbon dated. The combined interdisciplinary sources showed that O. edulis occurred in the inlets and open coast areas of NE Scotland, and specifically in the protected area: Probably since the end of the last glaciation to the late 1800s when they were likely over-fished. Present environmental conditions are also suitable for oyster restoration. Habitat restoration in protected areas is an emerging global theme. However, European oyster restoration effort is currently confined to remnant populations with a clear history of exploitation or dwindling associated fisheries. An interdisciplinary review of baselines will probably show scope for the restoration of O. edulis, for nature conservation, in many other European MPAs.},

@article{Alpine1992a,
abstract = {The recent invasion of San Francisco Bay by the suspension-feeding clam Potamocorbula amurensis has provided an opportunity to document the ecological consequences of a major biological disturbance. Previous work over the last two decades has shown that phytoplankton biomass in the upper estuary is low (2-3 mg Chl a m-3) during seasonal periods of high river flow and short residence time, and it is usually high (peak {\textgreater} 30 mg Chl a m-3) during the summer-autumn seasons of low river flow and long residence time. However since P. amurensis became widespread and abundant in 1987, the summer phytoplankton biomass maximum has disappeared, presumably because of increased grazing pressure by this newly introduced species. For the period 1977-1990, mean estimated primary production was only 39 g C m-2 yr-1 during years when bivalve suspension feeders were abundant ({\textgreater}2,000 m-2), compared to 106 g C m-2 yr-1 when bivalves were absent or present in low numbers. These observations support the hypothesis that seasonal and interannual fluctuations in estuarine phytoplankton biomass and primary production can be regulated jointly by direct physical effects (e.g. river-driven transport) and trophic interactions (episodes of enhanced grazing pressure by immigrant populations of benthic suspension feeders)},

abstract = {The ecological dynamics underlying species invasions have been a major focus of research in macroorganisms for the last five decades. However, we still know little about the processes behind invasion by unicellular organisms. To expand our knowledge of microbial invasions, we studied the roles of propagule pressure, nutrient supply, and biotic resistance in the invasion success of a freshwater invasive alga, Prymnesium parvum, using microcosms containing natural freshwater microbial assemblages. Microcosms were subjected to a factorial design with two levels of nutrient-induced diversity and three levels of propagule pressure, and incubated for 7 d, during which P. parvum densities and microbial community composition were tracked. Successful invasion occurred in microcosms receiving high propagule pressure whereas nutrients or community diversity played no role in invasion success. Invaded communities experienced distinctive changes in composition compared with communities where the invasion was unsuccessful. Successfully invaded microbial communities had an increased abundance of fungi and ciliates, and decreased abundances of diatoms and cercozoans. Many of these changes mirrored the microbial community changes detected during a natural P. parvum bloom in the source system. This role of propagule pressure is particularly relevant for P. parvum in the reservoir-dominated southern United States because this species can form large, sustained blooms that can generate intense propagule pressures for downstream sites. Human impact and global climate change are currently causing widespread environmental changes in most southern US freshwater systems that may facilitate P. parvum establishment and, when coupled with strong propagule pressure, could put many more systems at risk for invasion.},

abstract = {California's coastline continues to accumulate species introduced from all over the world. In San Diego County's estuarine and marine waters, the number of reported non-native species now stands at around 100 (Crooks 1998, unpublished data, Preisler et al. 2009). Among the many different taxa of invaders in this region, bivalve molluscs are of particular interest given their potential ecological and economic impacts and the relatively well-documented history of changes in bivalve assemblages over time (Crooks 2001). Bivalves in general are a relatively conspicuous group, their representation in the fossil record and in archeological sites make the deeper history of these organisms accessible, and local molluscan assemblages have also been focal organisms for study by scientists for 150 years. Some of the non-native molluscs reported in the San Diego area include the bay mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), the Japanese mussel (Musculista senhousia), and the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum). These are in addition to freshwater invaders of the county, including the Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) and the notorious quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). Despite repeated intentional introductions in San Diego, and California in general, one notable absence in the list of established mollusk invaders has been oysters. Herein we review isolated reports of introduced oysters into San Diego County and nearby areas in the 19th and 20th centuries, and then note what appears to be a successful establishment of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) that began around the turn of the 21st century. Movement of several species of non-native oysters into California began in the mid-1800s, driven by a desire to augment the declining fishery of the smaller native oyster, Ostrea lurida (Carlton 1979, Kirby 2004). Intentional introduction of Virginia oysters (Crassostrea virginica) from the U.S. east coast into California waters (San Francisco Bay) began in the 1860s, and by the 1880s Virginia oysters were planted on trial bases in Alamitos, Newport, and San Diego bays in southern California (Ingersoll 1881, Williamson 1894, Barrett 1963, Carlton 1979). There were some reports of what appears to be short-lived establishment of this species. In Alamitos Bay, Williamson (1894) noted an account that the Virginia oyster ground " embraces the whole of Alamitos and Anaheim Bays, " and Townsend (1893)},

abstract = {Random forest and similar Machine Learning techniques are already used to generate spatial predictions, but spatial location of points (geography) is often ignored in the modeling process. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the crossvalidation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is suboptimal. This paper presents a random forest for spatial predictions framework (RFsp) where buffer distances from observation points are used as explanatory variables, thus incorporating geographical proximity effects into the prediction process. The RFsp framework is illustrated with examples that use textbook datasets and apply spatial and spatio-temporal prediction to numeric, binary, categorical, multivariate and spatiotemporal variables. Performance of the RFsp framework is compared with the state-of-the-art kriging techniques using fivefold cross-validation with refitting. The results show that RFsp can obtain equally accurate and unbiased predictions as different versions of kriging. Advantages of using RFsp over kriging are that it needs no rigid statistical assumptions about the distribution and stationarity of the target variable, it is more flexible towards incorporating, combining and extending covariates of different types, and it possibly yields more informative maps characterizing the prediction error. RFsp appears to be especially attractive for building multivariate spatial prediction models that can be used as knowledge engines'' in various geoscience fields. Some disadvantages of RFsp are the exponentially growing computational intensity with increase of calibration data and covariates and the high sensitivity of predictions to input data quality. The key to the success of the RFsp framework might be the training data quality-especially quality of spatial sampling (to minimize extrapolation problems and any type of bias in data), and quality of model validation (to ensure that accuracy is not effected by overfitting). For many data sets, especially those with lower number of points and covariates and close-to-linear relationships, model-based geostatistics can still lead to more accurate predictions than RFsp.},

We refute this contention by presenting arguments, data, and model results, overlooked by these authors. Our analysis indicates that oyster populations living on extensive reefs along the flanks of the mainstem Bay could substantially reduce summer phytoplankton growth and particulate organic carbon deposition to deep waters of the central channel. Because hypoxia in these deep waters is maintained through microbial decomposition of organic carbon generated by summer phytoplankton production, we conclude that reduced carbon fluxes to the deep channel associated with greatly increased oyster grazing could reduce the severity of hypoxia.},

abstract = {Shorelines at the interface of marine, estuarine and terrestrial biomes are among the most degraded and threatened habitats in the coastal zone because of their sensitivity to sea level rise, storms and increased human utilization. Previous efforts to protect shorelines have largely involved constructing bulkheads and seawalls which can detrimentally affect nearshore habitats. Recently, efforts have shifted towards "living shoreline" approaches that include biogenic breakwater reefs. Our study experimentally tested the efficacy of breakwater reefs constructed of oyster shell for protecting eroding coastal shorelines and their effect on nearshore fish and shellfish communities. Along two different stretches of eroding shoreline, we created replicated pairs of subtidal breakwater reefs and established unaltered reference areas as controls. At both sites we measured shoreline and bathymetric change and quantified oyster recruitment, fish and mobile macro-invertebrate abundances. Breakwater reef treatments mitigated shoreline retreat by more than 40{\%} at one site, but overall vegetation retreat and erosion rates were high across all treatments and at both sites. Oyster settlement and subsequent survival were observed at both sites, with mean adult densities reaching more than eighty oysters m -2 at one site. We found the corridor between intertidal marsh and oyster reef breakwaters supported higher abundances and different communities of fishes than control plots without oyster reef habitat. Among the fishes and mobile invertebrates that appeared to be strongly enhanced were several economically-important species. Blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) were the most clearly enhanced (+297{\%}) by the presence of breakwater reefs, while red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) (+108{\%}), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) (+88{\%}) and flounder (Paralichthys sp.) (+79{\%}) also benefited. Although the vertical relief of the breakwater reefs was reduced over the course of our study and this compromised the shoreline protection capacity, the observed habitat value demonstrates ecological justification for future, more robust shoreline protection projects. {\textcopyright} 2011 Scyphers et al.},

abstract = {Due to their hydrophobicity and relatively large surface area, microplastics (MPs)can act as carriers of hydrophobic pollutants in the ocean and may facilitate their transfer to organisms. This study examined effects of dietary exposure to polystyrene MPs of 0.5 and 4.5 $\mu$m alone and with sorbed benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)on mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis in order to elucidate the effects of MP size and the presence of sorbed BaP on the organism. MPs were provided daily, mixed with algae, during 26 days at equivalent mass (0.058 mg/L), corresponding to 1000 particles/mL for 4.5 $\mu$m MPs and to 7.44 × 105 particles/mL for 0.5 $\mu$m MPs. Effects were determined on early cellular biomarkers in hemocytes, structure and cell type composition of digestive tubules (DTs), histopathology and whole organism responses (condition index (CI), clearance rate (CR), food absorption efficiency (AE), respiration rate (RR)and scope for growth (SFG)). BaP concentrations in mussels increased with time, in particular when sorbed to smaller MPs. Large MPs were abundant in the lumen of stomach and DTs, but were also occasionally found within epithelial cells. Effects in all treatments increased with exposure time. MPs with sorbed BaP were more toxic than MPs alone according to hemocyte viability and catalase activity and to the quantitative structure of DT epithelium. Higher toxicity of small MPs compared to larger ones was recorded for DNA damage and cell composition of DTs. At tissue level a slight increase in prevalence of inflammatory responses occurred in all exposed groups. At whole organism level a compensatory effect was observed on absorption efficiency across MP treatments at day 26, resulting in increased SFG in mussels exposed to small MPs with sorbed BaP. This could be related to an increased energy need to deal with stress observed in biomarkers. Further work is required to understand the Trojan horse effect of a variety of plastic type, size, shape combinations together with a wide variety of pollutants.},

abstract = {Ecological restoration frequently involves setting fixed species or habitat targets to be achieved by pre- scribed restoration activities or through natural processes. Where no reference systems exist for defining outcomes or where restoration is planned on a large spatial scale, a more ‘open-ended' approach to defining outcomes may be appropriate. Such approaches require changes to the definition of goals and the design of monitoring and evaluation activities. We suggest that in open-ended projects restoration goals should be framed in terms of promoting natural processes, mobile landscape mosaics and improved ecosystem services. Monitoring can then focus on the biophysical processes that underpin the develop- ment of habitat mosaics and the provision of ecosystem services, on the way habitat mosaics change through time and on species that can indicate the changing landscape attributes of connectivity and scale. Stakeholder response should be monitored since an open-ended restoration approach is unusual and can encounter institutional and societal constraints. Evaluation should focus on reporting changing restoration impacts and benefits rather than on achieving a pre-defined concept of ecological success.},

abstract = {An open-top chamber was designed for measuring ambient community clearance rate on undisturbed bivalve populations in the field. The chamber was pressed 5-10 cm down in the sediment on the mussel bed. It holds approximately 30-40 cm water column equal to a volume of 43-77 L. It was provided with an air lift connected to a SCUBA diver pressure tank generating a continuous and gentle water circulation. This ensures a complete mixture of suspended particles, and thereby, a maximum filtration by the bivalves. An in situ fluorometer was mounted to record plant pigment reduction due to mussel clearance in real-time. To calibrate the in situ fluorometer triplicate water samples were obtained initially in each of the bivalve filtration measurements. The water samples were filtrated, extracted, and later analyzed for plant pigment concentration on a laboratory spectrophotometer. The main conclusion is that bivalve community clearance was an order of magnitude lower than predicted from laboratory extrapolations, which we explain by a natural variable activity level among the individuals in a given bivalve assemblage. {\textcopyright} 2011, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

Globally, bivalves have higher production than any other cultured animal. Large populations of natural, invasive, and cultured bivalves are suggested to cause changes in coastal ecosys- tem function through suspension-feeding of particles and biodeposition of waste materials. Association of bivalves with particle depletion is a trophic tenet of coastal ecosystems, but there are no previous observations of this process except at small scales. Using airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, we show direct evidence of aquaculture impacts at the ecosystem scale (kilometres), documenting significant depletion of phytoplankton through a blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) farm in eastern Canada, compared with dispersion in circulation model results without mussels. Understanding of factors controlling primary production and ecosystem processes in the coastal zone is critical in light of growing reliance on this region for development and resource extraction worldwide},

Olympia oysters were found at 74 locations, 76 {\%} of all sites examined. Three geographic areas were surveyed: West Coast Vancouver Island (Barkley, Clayoquot and Nootka Sounds), Strait of Georgia (eastern coast of Vancouver Island from Goldstream to Comox, Mainland Inlets/Sunshine Coast and Boundary Bay) and the Strait of Juan de Fuca (Victoria, Esquimalt and Sooke). Generally, O. lurida was found to be widespread and abundant on the west coast of Vancouver Island, with populations forming dense reefs in many locations. The species was widespread in the Strait of Georgia, but abundance was relatively low and oysters tended to occupy cryptic habitats. Exceptions included moderately dense populations in Ladysmith Harbour, Hotham Sound and Jervis Inlet. The Gorge Waterway in Victoria Harbour was found to support abundant populations both in the intertidal and subtidal zones, with abundance increasing with depth. Previous observations of subtidal Olympia oyster reefs forming three-dimensional reef structures in the Gorge Waterway were confirmed. Further surveys are required on the north-western coast of Vancouver Island, Johnstone and Queen Charlotte Straits and North Coast to supplement the understanding of the distribution and abundance of the this species in British Columbia.},

abstract = {The effects of ocean acidification (OA), which results from increased CO2 emissions, are of particular concern for calcifying marine organisms. In marine invertebrates, the larval stages are generally considered the most vulnerable to the effects of OA and many recent studies show negative impacts of OA on early developmental stages of calcifying marine invertebrates. I studied the impact of OA on larval swimming performance and behavior in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida. Swimming studies can be used to understand how short-term performance and behavior changes may affect the long-term success of populations. In this study, digital larval tracking was used to test for changes in swimming performance and behavior in larvae reared at pCO2 levels of 400, 800, and 1200 ppm. Experiments were run on hatchery-bred larvae from the beginning of the larval period to the pediveliger stage. Morphological and energetic changes were analyzed to determine if they corresponded to swimming performance and behavior differences between pCO2 treatments. Results showed few swimming performance changes in C. gigas larvae and no changes in swimming behavior, suggesting that transport will not be affected by OA in this species. However, C. gigas was affected morphologically and energetically by OA. O. lurida increased swimming speeds in response to increased pCO2 levels, but vertical displacement velocity did not change. O. lurida also increased helical pitch and energy allocated to swimming in response to OA, but did not show any morphological changes. Swimming performance and behavior changes observed in O. lurida suggest that OA could affect larval transport and connectivity in this species, ultimately affecting the success of later developmental stages.},

abstract = {Suspension-feeding bivalves serve to couple pelagic and benthic processes because they filter suspended particles from the water column and the undigested remains ejected as mucus-bound feces and pseudofeces, sink to the sediment surface. This biodeposition call be extremely important in regulating water column processes where bivalves are abundant in coastal waters and in seasons when water temperatures are warm enough to promote active feeding. Bivalves under these conditions can exert "top-down" grazer control on phytoplankton and in the process reduce turbidity thereby increasing the amount of light reaching the sediment surface. This has the effect of reducing the dominance of phytoplankton production and extending the depth to which ecologically important benthic plants, such as seagrasses and benthic microalgae, can grow. Nitrogen and phosphorus, excreted by the bivalves and regenerated from then biodeposits, are recycled back to the water column and support further phytoplankton production. In some situations, however, bivalves can also exert "bottom-up" nutrient control on phytoplankton production by changing nutrient regeneration processes within the sediment. Some of the N and P that vas originally incorporated in phytoplankton, but was not digested by the bivalves. can become buried in the accumulating sediments. Where biodeposits are incorporated in aerobic surficial sediments that overlay deeper anaerobic sediments, microbially mediated, coupled nitrification-denitrification can permanently remove N from the sediments as N-2 gas. Consequently, natural and aquaculture-reared stocks of bivalves are potentially a useful supplement to watershed management activities intended to reduce phytoplankton production by curbing anthropogenic N and P inputs to eutrophied aquatic systems. Environmental conditions at bivalve aquaculture sites should be carefully monitored, however, because biodeposition at very high bivalve densities may be so intense that the resulting microbial respiration reduces the oxygen content of the surrounding sediments. Reduction in sediment oxygen content can inhibit coupled nitrification-denitrification, cause P to become unbound and released to the water column and the resulting buildup of H2S can be toxic to the benthos.},

abstract = {Restoration of native species may be hampered by competition with non-native species. The outcomes of competition are often context-dependent, with one species dominating under some conditions but not others. Where non-natives differ from natives in their ability to tolerate stressful environmental conditions, restoration practitioners may be able to manipulate conditions or strategically locate restoration projects along naturally occurring stress gradients to favor native species. We tested the responses of native oysters and a suite of non-native sessile invertebrate species (mostly soft-bodied organisms) to varying tidal elevations, shoreline types, and distances from source populations. Cover of non-natives was lower at higher tidal elevation and far from adult populations. Native oyster recruitment was also reduced at the high tidal elevation. At this elevation oyster dominance was increased, but abundance was reduced. To test an adaptive management approach, we moved substrates from the low to high tidal elevations. Cover of non-natives had decreased dramatically one year later, while oyster metrics were unaffected or improved compared to those on substrates remaining at the low elevation. Our study indicates that reduction of non-native species abundance, often an explicit goal of restoration, may be achieved by strategic location of restoration units, although abundance of target species may also be reduced, at least over the short term. However, restoration practitioners may be able to increase abundance of target species and reduce non-natives by applying stress differentially over time, with benign conditions during sensitive early life stages, and increasing stress after target organisms become more tolerant.},

The trophic consequences of increasing the oyster population may be addressed using a simple quasi-equilibrium, mass action model of the exchanges transpiring in the Chesapeake mesohaline ecosystem. According to output from the model, increasing oyster abundance would decrease phytoplankton productivity as well as stocks of pelagic microbes, ctenophores, medusae, and particulate organic carbon. Recently acquired field data on phytoplankton productivity, bacterioplankton, and labile organic carbon in the vicinity of rafted oyster aquaculture support model predictions. The model also indicates that more oysters should increase benthic primary production, fish stocks, and mesozooplankton densities. Hence, augmenting the oyster community by restoring beds or introducing raft culture represents a potentially significant adjunct to the goal of mitigating eutrophication through curtailment of nutrient inputs. *** DIRECT SUPPORT *** A01BY059 00005 {\textcopyright} 1992, Estuarine Research Federation.

The oyster established itself everywhere and expanded rapidly throughout the receiving ecosystems, forming extensive and dense reef structures. It became clear that the Pacific oyster induced major changes in NW European estuaries. This paper reviews the causes of the Pacific oyster's remarkably successful establishment and spread in The Netherlands and neighbouring countries, and includes a comprehensive review of consequences for the receiving communities.Ecosystem engineering by C. gigas and a relative lack of natural enemies in receiving ecosystems are identified as the most important characteristics facilitating the invader's successful establishment and expansion. The Pacific oyster's large filtration capacity and eco-engineering characteristics induced many changes in receiving ecosystems. Different estuaries are affected differently; in the Dutch Oosterschelde estuary expanding stocks saturate the carrying capacity whereas in the Wadden Sea no such problems exist. In general, the Pacific oyster seems to fit well within continental NW European estuarine ecosystems and there is no evidence that the invader outcompetes native bivalves. C. gigas induces changes in plankton composition, habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity, carrying capacity, food webs and parasite life cycles.The case of the Pacific oyster in NW European estuaries is only one example in an increasing series of biological invasions mediated by human activities. This case-study will contribute to further elucidating general mechanisms in marine invasions; invasions that sometimes appear a threat, but can also contribute to ecological complexity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Populations of O. lurida occur in Yaquina Bay, Netarts Bay, and Coos Bay, although only the population in Yaquina Bay seems likely to have been continuous since prewestern settlement. The historical occurrence of Olympia (native) oysters in Yaquina and Netarts Bays is confirmed by numerous records of fishery landings. In contrast, historic populations in Coos Bay are inferred by the presence of large shell deposits buried in sediments throughout the polyhaline (salinity {\textgreater} 18–30) region of the estuary. Other Oregon estuaries (such as Tillamook, Alsea, and Umpqua/Winchester Bay) may have had ambient environmental conditions suitable to support self-sustaining populations of O. lurida, but none of these estuaries are currently inhabited by natural populations, nor do they exhibit clear historical records of occupation in the past.

abstract = {Great Sound is a 6 km2 shallow (average depth = 0.6 m) lagoon fringed by salt marsh and connected directly to the ocean by two large (5 and 10 km long) flood-dominated tidal channels which enter at opposite ends. The lagoon can be divided into three subenvironments: flood tidal delta and channel, transition area, and basin. Tidal deltas containing several distributary channels are deposited from expanding jet flow as tidal currents enter the lagoon. A physical process study (velocity profiles, salinity, temperature, suspended load and box cores) indicated that sedimentation patterns are determined by: (1) proximity to the point sources of sediment, the tidal channels, (2) spatial changes in tidal current strength and abundance of benthic organisms (primarily sand-trapping macroalgae), (3) dispersion of particulates by tidal and wave-generated currents, and (4) postdepositional processes including bioturbation and resuspension by waves. Tidal currents ranged from Umax {\textgreater} 40 cm/s (U*max = 4.0 cm/s) in the tidal delta channels, to Umax {\textless} 20 cm/s (U*max = 2.6 cm/s) in transition areas to Umax {\textless} 10 cm/s (U*max {\textless} 1.0 cm/s) in the basins. Umax, U*max = maximum current velocity and maximum shear velocity respectively. Typical suspended sediment loads were 10-50 mg/l near the bottom; however, sediment transport was enhanced by wind-generated waves (up to 0.5 m wave height) which eroded the bottom creating concentration spikes of greater than 300 mg/l. Bottom sediments ranged from well-sorted fine sand in most delta and channel areas to basins composed of 90{\%} silt and clay. Factors affecting sediment supply, transportation, deposition and resuspension interact in complex ways so that wide variability in the textural characteristics of deposited sediment occurs and no single factor (e.g., velocity) is well correlated with sediment characteristics. A conceptual model illustrating these spatial relations between hydrodynamics, benthos and sedimentation in the Great Sound system, was developed. The model should be useful in other tide-dominated coastal lagoons as a guide for design of benthic and sedimentary studies. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {The feeding activities of bivalve mollusks have direct impacts on suspended particles in nature. Feeding is also related to the carrying capacity of a particular system for maximal aquaculture production. Particle removal is known to be dependent upon particle characteristics, including size and type, because particle retention efficiency is size dependent, and bivalves are able to select particles actively to improve the quality of food ingested. Our goal was to quantify particle clearance by northern bay scallops of natural seston under semi-natural conditions, i.e., in raceway tanks receiving a constant flow of untreated, estuarine water. Particle clearance rate (CR) was determined based upon particle counts in tank inflow and outflow streams. A flow-cytometric technique was developed allowing rapid quantification of particles with different sizes and characterization by presence or absence of chlorophyll fluorescence simultaneously. CR varied greatly (ranging from 0.06 to 3.02 L h- 1 gDW- 1) among sizes and types of particles. CR of large particles was generally higher than that of the smaller particles. Under the specific conditions of this experiment, particle selectivity appeared to be ineffective because scallops did not show a higher CR on phytoplankton than on detritus. This study demonstrated the feasibility of this flow-cytometric approach to measure differential clearance of different particles in natural seston by suspension-feeding organisms.},

abstract = {No-take reserves constitute one tool to improve conservation of marine ecosystems, yet criteria for their placement, size, and arrangement remain uncertain. Representation of biodiversity is necessary in reserve planning, but will ultimately fail for conservation unless factors affecting species' persistence are also incorporated. This study presents an empirical example of the divergent relationships among multiple metrics used to quantify a site's conservation value, including those that address representation (habitat type, species richness, species diversity), and others that address ecological processes and viability (density and reproductive capacity of a keystone species, in this case, the black chiton, Katharina tunicata). We characterized 10 rocky intertidal sites across two habitats in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, according to these site metrics. High-richness and high-production sites for K. tunicata were present in both habitat types, but high richness and high-production sites did not overlap. Across sites, species richness ranged from 29 to 46, and adult K. tunicata varied from 6 to 22 individuals m-2. Adult density was negatively correlated with species richness, a pattern that likely occurs due to post-recruitment growth and survival because no correlation was evident with non-reproductive juveniles. Sites with high adult density also contributed disproportionately greater potential reproductive output (PRO), defined by total gonad mass. PRO varied by a factor of five across sites and was also negatively correlated with species richness. Compromise or relative weighting would be necessary to select valuable sites for conservation because of inherent contradictions among some reserve selection criteria. We suspect that this inconsistency among site metrics will occur more generally in other ecosystems and emphasize the importance of population viability of strongly interacting species. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We tested the ability of six quantitative genetic models to explain the evolution of phenotypic means using an extensive database compiled by Gingerich. Our approach differs from past efforts in that we use explicit models of evolutionary process, with parameters estimated from contemporary populations, to analyze a large sample of divergence data on many different timescales. We show that one quantitative genetic model yields a good fit to data on phenotypic divergence across timescales ranging from a few generations to 10 million generations. The key feature of this model is a fitness optimum that moves within fixed limits. Conversely, a model of neutral evolution, models with a stationary optimum that undergoes Brownian or white noise motion, a model with a moving optimum, and a peak shift model all fail to account for the data on most or all timescales. We discuss our results within the framework of Simpson's concept of adaptive landscapes and zones. Our analysis suggests that the underlying process causing phenotypic stasis is adaptation to an optimum that moves within an adaptive zone with stable boundaries. We discuss the implication of our results for comparative studies and phylogeny inference based on phenotypic characters. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The University of Chicago.},

Today, phyloge- netics—the science of constructing and evaluating hypoth- eses about historical patterns of descent in the form of evolutionary trees—has become pervasive within and increasingly outside evolutionary biology. Fostering skills in “tree thinking” is therefore a critical component of biological education. Conversely, misconceptions about evolutionary trees can be very detrimental to one's understanding of the patterns and processes that have occurred in the history of life. This paper provides a basic introduction to evolutionary trees, including some guide- lines for how and how not to read them.

abstract = {We reviewed studies providing quantitative measurements of abundance of fishes and large mobile crustaceans on oyster reefs and on nearby sedimentary habitat in the southeast United States. For each species, we compared density by size (age) class on oyster reefs and sedimentary bottom as a means of estimating the degree to which restoration of oyster reef on sedimentary bottom could augment abundances. By applying published information on growth rates of each species and a combination of empirical data and published information on age-specific survivorship, we calculated the per-unit-area enhancement of production of fishes and large mobile crustaceans expected from the addition of oyster reef habitat. For this calculation, we gave the reef habitat full credit for the expected lifetime production of species whose recruitment was judged to be limited by the area of oyster reefs based on nearly exclusive association of recruits to reefs. For species that were only modestly enhanced in abundance by oyster reefs, we gave the reef credit for the fraction of production that is derived from consumption of reef-associated prey, using a combination of gut content data and natural history information. This combination of analyses and calculations revealed that 10 m2 of restored oyster reef in the southeast United States is expected to yield an additional 2.6 kg yr -1 of production of fish and large mobile crustaceans for the functional lifetime of the reef. Because the reef is biogenic and self-sustaining, the lifetime of a reef protected from bottom-disturbing fishing gear is limited by intense storms or sedimentation. A reef lasting 20 to 30 yr would be expected to augment fish and large mobile crustacean production by a cumulative amount of 38 to 50 kg 10 m-2, discounted to present-day value. This set of calculations assumes that oyster reef habitat now limits production of reef-associated fish and crustaceans in the southeast United States. This assumption seems reasonable based on the tight associations of so many fishes with reef-dependent prey, and the depletion of reef habitat over the past century.},

abstract = {Suspension feeding bivalves are commonly associated with seagrass habitats in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Biodeposits of some suspension feeding bivalves have been shown to be high in nitrogen and phosphorus. Consequently, filter feeding bivalves may act as a benthopelagic couple bringing planktonic production to the benthos, thereby elevating submerged aquatic vegetation growth by increasing the nutrients available to the rhizosphere. Laboratory feeding experiments were used to calculate the filtration rate of a typical suspension feeding bivalve Modiolus americanus. Filtration rates were estimated to be 2.87 ± 0.82 1 h-1 g tissue dry weight-1. Consumption rates were estimated to be 9.41±2.62 $\mu$g Chl a h-1 g tissue dry weight-1. In addition, field experiments were used to calculate mean biodeposition rates. Biodeposition rates were estimated to be 2.25±0.36 g dry wt material g tissue dry weight day-1. Therefore, at mean field densities M. americanus are capable of depositing 218 kg dry weight material m-2 annually. These deposits will contain 215 g N and 7.1 g P. A flower pot experiment demonstrated that the biodeposits of M. americanus were capable of increasing the pore water nutrient content and a mussel density manipulation in the field revealed that the presence of mussels significantly reduced leaf tissue C:N and C:P ratios. Pore water ammonium and phosphate concentrations were four times greater in the highest mussel density than in the control treatments and the lower leaf tissue C:N and C:P ratios in the presence of mussels established that this increased pore water nutrient was available to the seagrass, Thalassia testudinum. Collectively, these experiments suggest that suspension feeding bivalves may be important resource conduits converting inaccessible PON and POP in the water column to elevated sediment nutrient levels within the rhizosphere available for absorption by submerged aquatic vegetation.},

While this loss of habitat is well documented, the loss of associated ecosystem services remains poorly quantified. Meanwhile, ecosystem service recovery has become a major impetus for restoration. Here we propose a model for estimating the volume of water filtered by oyster populations under field conditions and make estimates of the contribution of past (c. 1880–1910) and present (c. 2000–2010) oyster populations to improving water quality in 13 US estuaries. We find that filtration capacity of oysters has declined almost universally (12 of the 13 estuaries examined) by a median of 85 {\%}. Whereas historically, oyster populations achieved full estuary filtration (filtering a volume equivalent or larger than the entire estuary volume within the residence time of the water) in six of the eight estuaries in the Gulf of Mexico during summer months, this is now the case for only one estuary: Apalachicola Bay, Florida. By contrast, while all five estuaries on the North Atlantic coast showed large decreases in filtration capacity, none were achieving full estuary filtration at the time of our c. 1900 historic baseline. This apparent difference from the Gulf of Mexico is explained at least in part by our North Atlantic baseline representing a shifted baseline, as surveyed populations were already much reduced by exploitation in this region.},

abstract = {To evaluate oyster food supply, water samples were collected at fifteen sites in Delaware Bay nearmonthly in 2009 and 2010. Food was estimated as the sum of particulate protein, labile carbohydrate, and lipid. Delaware Bay shows a typical spring bloom, centered in March and April, with declining food supply thereafter into early fall, followed sporadically by a minor fall bloom. The geographic and temporal structure of food was more predictable in summer to early fall, and considerably less predictable in spring. Five variables each based on temperature and the spatial and temporal variability of temperature were significant contributors to a multiple regression (R2 = 0.28). Cluster analysis on residuals identified two large groups of sites, one comprising most sites on the eastern side of the bay including all of the sites on the New Jersey oyster beds downestuary of the uppermost beds and one including most of the sites along the central channel and waters west. Food values over the New Jersey oyster beds were often depressed by as much as 50{\%} relative to the bay-wide mean. Food values did not follow an upestuary-downestuary trend anticipated from the salinity gradient. Rather, the differential was cross-bay and was distinctive throughout the estuarine salinity gradient, thus explaining the lack of significance of any salinity-related variable in the multiple regression. The consequence is that food supply cannot be sufficiently predicted or modeled based on observed environmental variables or those predicted from a hydrodynamic model. The cross-bay differential cannot be extracted from such datasets. The oyster reefs of Delaware Bay are dominantly sited on the New Jersey side, where food supply was most depressed and where passive particle residence times were longest. While not conclusive, this dataset suggests that oysters can influence food values on the New Jersey side of the bay at present biomass, and this would explain the cross-bay gradient in food values as an outcome of oyster feeding.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyse methods that have been used to quantify the different physiological processes involved in food acquisition and absorption by suspension-feeding bivalves. In particular, we have considered those methods that have been used for determining food processing rates under ambient conditions of food availability. During the last few years, an increasing number of studies has been performed using the biodeposition method, which estimates feeding and absorption rates through measurements of suspended particles and biodeposit production. The main assumption of this method is that ingested particulate inorganic matter can be used as an inert tracer of feeding and digestive processes, i.e. that secretion or absorption of inorganic matter across the gut wall is negligible. There are several points that have to be taken into account when applying this method: a) the method assumes that sampled suspended particles and those retained by the gill are of similar organic content; b) faeces and pseuclofaeces collection must he quantitative and separate and particle sedimentation must be controlled, if not avoided; c) where particulate food availability or composition is expected to fluctuate, the time lag for particles being captured and processed before they appear in the form of biodeposits must be evaluated to provide a proper reference value for available food. The biodeposition method and more conventional procedures provide equivalent results for estimating clearance rates. Moreover, predictions of scope for growth obtained with this technique also seem to be compatible with directly measured growth rates.},

abstract = {The English Channel is a marginal coastal sea located between the south coast of England and the northern coast of France. It is joined to the Celtic Sea (and hence the North Atlantic Ocean) in the west, and to the North Sea at its northeastern corner. Maximum depths range from 40 m in the east to 100 m in the west, extending to 160 m in the Hurd Deep. The most important factor influencing the occurrence, abundance and distribution of intertidal and marine plant and animal species is the temperature of the water column and its variation. The sensitivity of species to temperature may be enhanced as the Channel lies at the boundary of two biogeographical provinces, the warm Lusitanean and the colder Boreal. Other important factors for benthic species include bed characteristics and physical disturbance. The coastlines of France and England sustain a wide variety of natural habitats, including cliffs, rocky and sandy shores, shingle, dunes, salt marshes and saline lagoons. There are also a large number of estuaries, with freshwater inflow dominated by the River Seine. Extensive stretches of the coast are rural and support low-intensity arable farming. Interspersed along the coast are urban and industrial centres; the total population of the Channel coast is approximately 8 million, although this can increase significantly during the summer tourist season. The Channel is one of the world's busiest areas for shipping. The region also supports a commercially important fishery (both fish and shellfish) and is a nationally important region for sand and gravel extraction. Human activities on the coastal and marine environment have manifested themselves in a number of ways, including land reclamation, chemical pollution and fishing. These pressures remain palpable, although today a large number of national and transnational protective measures are in place. Indeed, natural factors may exert greater stresses on the coastline in the near future as the combined effects of sea-level rise and increasing storminess become more apparent. Within the last decade there has been a realisation that an important way to protect the coastline in a sustainable manner is for all parties with a stake in the coastal and marine environment to coordinate their activities within an ongoing economic, management and legislative framework. This Integrated Coastal Zone Management is being actively adopted within this region, and is likely to be the key to the long-term protection of the English Channel.},

abstract = {The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, well known throughout the world because of its ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions, was introduced for cultivation into France on a massive scale in the 1970s. With global warming, the reproductive population, confined at the beginning to the south of the French Atlantic coast, became established at more northern latitudes (above 45° 58′ N), and wild C. gigas began to colonize coastal areas such as our study site, Bourgneuf Bay (1°–2° W, 46°–47° N), an oyster-farming site. An original approach, based on orthophotograph analysis and in situ biomass sampling, revealed that, in the northern part of this bay, more than 70{\%} of the total C. gigas biomass was composed of wild oysters (i.e. C. gigas not bred by oystermen). The analysis of the spatial distribution of wild oysters indicated that 75{\%} of the stock consisted of wild oysters in natural beds (rocky areas) and on low retaining walls of former fisheries. Wild C. gigas also colonized oyster-farming structures with lower biomasses (21{\%} of the stock composed of wild oysters), but locally they could reach densities of up to 55 kg.m−1 i.e. 2.5 times the mean biomass of cultivated oysters. The economic and ecological consequences of this colonization by C. gigas of an oyster culture site are discussed. Wild oyster seems to be the principal trophic competitor of cultivated oysters in Bourgneuf Bay. This may partly explain the decrease in growth of cultivated oysters observed in this bay during the last decade. Moreover, the trophic and spatial competition exerted by wild oysters may also affect the native biota and, in particular, the honeycomb worm Sabellaria alveolata. The results obtained in this study have led oyster farmers and regional authorities to modify oyster-farming practices and to destroy wild oyster stocks in concession areas.},

abstract = {While spatial scale is increasingly incorporated into ecological experiments, the effect of temporal scale is explicitly investigated less frequently, despite the potential for temporal-scale dependent results. This study was designed to investigate the effect of variations in stress duration on responses, in a situation where stress duration is driven by natural storm events. Specifically, the utility of combining short-term laboratory and longer-term field transplant experiments in assessing the effect of increased suspended sediment concentrations on suspension-feeding bivalves (Austrovenus stutchburyi and Paphies australis) was tested. Short-term (2 days) feeding responses did not reflect feeding or biomass responses over slightly longer time-scales (8-14 days). Also, stronger biomass responses to suspended sediment concentrations were observed after three months in the field, than after 14 days in the laboratory. For unimodal responses, increased stress duration decreased the peak and shifted its location to lower suspended sediment levels. Using continuous measures of field suspended sediment concentrations, the study was able to determine the temporal scale of variability most related to the response. With such information, field surveys and transplants together make a useful tool, preventing co-occurring factors and changes in the duration and intensity of the factors of interest from obscuring results. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Despite the recently renewed interest by ecologists and government agencies to reestablish historical populations of the Olympia oyster, focus has been limited to projects located at the north of this species' range, with little or no attention to southern California and Baja populations. In addition, historical information on the status of natural populations across the range has been mainly qualitative in nature, with no comprehensive information on the current status of natural populations. The focus of this study was to conduct the first large-scale quantitative biogeographic survey of remnant populations of the Olympia oyster and to identify suitable sites in southern California for future restoration projects. We surveyed intertidal populations at 24 historical sites during spring and summer 2005 and summer 2006, established presence/absence and collected data on densities and percent cover. Average maximum densities ranged from 0.0-36.7 ± 12.1 oysters per 0.25 m 2 . In southern California, intertidal populations were present in all bays and estuaries south of Morro Bay and most showed evidence of regular recruitment. Thus, all southern California sites could present favorable opportunities for restoration projects. At the north end of the range, intertidal populations were more often absent from sites, though there was evidence of subtidal populations. Populations were absent from intertidal sites at the northern endpoint of its distribution in Sitka, Alaska. We speculate that the current northern range limit of this species is located in northern British Columbia. Intertidal populations were also absent at two CA sites, Morro Bay, and Big Lagoon; anecdotal evidence further suggests that subtidal populations were also absent. This study represents the first comprehensive biogeographic survey of intertidal populations of the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida , and identifies sites in southern California as suitable locations for future restoration projects.},

abstract = {An extensive body of work suggests that altered marine carbonate chemistry can negatively influence marine invertebrates, but few studies have examined how effects are moderated and persist in the natural environment. A particularly important question is whether impacts initiated in early life might be exacerbated or attenuated over time in the presence or absence of other stressors in the field. We reared Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) larvae in laboratory cultures under control and elevated seawater pCO2 concentrations, quantified settlement success and size at metamorphosis, then outplanted juveniles to Tomales Bay, California, in the mid intertidal zone where emersion and temperature stress were higher, and in the low intertidal zone where conditions were more benign. We tracked survival and growth of outplanted juveniles for 4 months, halfway to reproductive age. Survival to metamorphosis in the laboratory was strongly affected by larval exposure to elevated pCO2 conditions. Survival of juvenile outplants was reduced dramatically at mid shore compared to low shore levels regardless of the pCO2 level that oysters experienced as larvae. However, juveniles that were exposed to elevated pCO2 as larvae grew less than control individuals, representing a larval carry-over effect. Although juveniles grew less at mid shore than low shore levels, there was no evidence of an interaction between the larval carry-over effect and shore level, suggesting little modulation of acidification impacts by emersion or temperature stress. Importantly, the carry-over effects of larval exposure to ocean acidification remained unabated 4 months later with no evidence of compensatory growth, even under benign conditions. This latter result points to the potential for extended consequences of brief exposures to altered seawater chemistry with potential consequences for population dynamics.},

abstract = {This paper describes the linkage of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic circulation model with descriptive and experimental biological data concerning oyster (Crassostrea virginica) population dynamics in the Apalachicola Estuary (Florida, U.S.A.). Our intent was to determine the direct and indirect role of Apalachicola River flow in the maintenance of oyster production. Results of a monthly field sampling programme conducted on the oyster reefs in the Apalachicola system during 1985-1986 were used to develop statistical models relating several life-history characteristics of oysters to physical-chemical aspects of water quality. The same life-history characteristics were related statistically to output from a circulation model of Apalachicola Bay. Highest oyster densities and overall bar growth were found in the vicinity of the confluence of high salinity water moving westwards from St George Sound and river-dominated (low salinity) water moving south and eastwards from East Bay. With the exception of models for oyster mortality, the predictive capability of results from the parallel modelling efforts was low. A time-averaged model was developed for oyster mortality during the summer of 1985 by running a regression analysis with averaged predictors derived from the hydrodynamic model and observed (experimental) mortality rates throughout the estuary. A geographic information system was then used to depict the results spatially and to compare the extent of expected mortality in 1985 and 1986. High salinity, relatively low-velocity current patterns, and the proximity of a given oyster bar to entry points of saline Gulf water into the bay were important factors that contribute to increased oyster mortality. Mortality was a major determinant of oyster production in the Apalachicola Estuary with predation as a significant aspect of such mortality. By influencing salinity levels and current patterns throughout the bay, the Apalachicola River was important in controlling such mortality. Oyster production rates in the Apalachicola system depend on a combination of variables that are directly and indirectly associated with freshwater input as modified by wind, tidal factors, and the physiography of the bay. River flow reduction, whether through naturally occurring droughts, through increased upstream anthropogenous (consumptive) water use, or a combination of the two, could have serious adverse consequences for oyster populations. By coupling hydrodynamic modelling with descriptive and experimental biological data, we were able to determine the effects of potential freshwater diversions on oyster production in Apalachicola Bay.

To examine the recovery of a mussel population after periods of severe predation and anoxia, and to estimate the amount of nutrients removed from the system through mussel production, we surveyed, over 2 years, the Musculista senhousia population in the estuarine lagoon, Lake Nakaumi, Japan. Predation by diving ducks (Aythya fuligula, Aythya ferina and Aythya marila) during winter dramatically reduced the mussel biomass in both years, but recruitment of juvenile mussels sustained the population. Anoxia during the second summer severely reduced the mussel population, resulting in less biomass than in the autumn of the previous year. Potential annual removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the lagoon water through burial of M. senhousia shells under oxic conditions was estimated to be 7.1 and 5.1 tons, respectively. These are equivalent to 0.7{\%} and 4.9{\%} of the nitrogen and phosphorous annual load entering the lagoon via the main river. Under anoxic conditions, removal would decrease to only 5.6{\%} of the potential amount. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Most Atlantic and Gulf coast U.S. states with an oyster fishery have operated some form of oyster reef enhancement program over the past 50 years. Although programs were initially only directed at oyster fisheries augmentation, recent emphasis has shifted to include the restoration of their ecological functions. Furthermore, many of these programs are managed by environmental organizations or state agencies not traditionally involved in fisheries management or research, but rather in ecological restoration, monitoring, and/or environmental education. A simple assessment of shellfish meetings over the past five years, including the inaugural Restore America's Estuaries meeting from which this paper is derived, revealed more than 300 presentations related to oyster restoration, with fewer than 25{\%} focused solely on oyster fishery restoration. Unfortunately, many of those efforts lacked well-defined "success criteria," with progress often judged using fisheries-based metrics such as market-sized (generally 75 mm or 3") oysters. Here we discuss our findings as they relate to the value of alternative restoration metrics and associated success criteria using data from two very different systems and approaches: one conducted in Virginia's lower Chesapeake Bay (Rappahannock River), based on data from a two-year program utilizing subtidally constructed reefs of different reef "scale," and the other a long-term study in South Carolina focusing on intertidal reefs. For each system, we compared newly created reef structures, relating oyster abundance and size to resident species abundance and biodiversity over time. Our results revealed positive correlations between several community descriptors and the size and density of oysters on the reefs. Of the 15 significant (and 5 marginally insignificant) correlations observed out of a total of 78 examined across both studies, all but one were positive. The exception was for epifaunal invertebrate diversity vs. oyster biomass on the Rappahannock reefs. Despite these numerous positive correlations, none indicated that market-sized oysters are a prerequisite for supporting an abundant and diverse community. For example, intertidal oysters {\textgreater}75 mm in South Carolina typically make up {\textless}10{\%} of all reef oysters, with a maximum of 18{\%}. Finally, until we have a more thorough understanding of the interactions between individual species and the mechanisms linking oyster populations and reef community attributes, we propose that oyster abundance/size structure be used for assessments. Future studies need to develop and evaluate restoration progress using a combination of standardized criteria that can be applied to reef success over a wide geographical range and surrogate or indirect ecological measures (e.g., filtering, habitat use).

abstract = {Aquaculture is viewed as a potential mechanism to meet the growing demand for seafood around the world. The future of bivalve shellfish aquaculture in the U.S. hinges on sustainable practices on the part of industry and a more consistent regulatory regime. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture is a recent practice relative to its history in other countries, beginning in the late 1800s along the U.S. West Coast where it is now well established with farm raised product utilizing land-based hatcheries and grow-out directly in numerous estuaries. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture can be viewed as a disturbance which modifies the estuarine system in three ways: 1) changes in material processes - bivalves process food and produce wastes; 2) addition of physical structure - aquaculture introduces the cultured organisms and in some cases a physical anchoring structure; and 3) pulse disturbances like harvest and bed maintenance disturb sediments, remove species in addition to the cultured organisms themselves, and change resource or habitat availability. In U.S. West Coast estuaries, water column and sediment nutrient concentrations are relatively high and influenced by large tidal exchange and proximity to deeper nearshore ocean waters where upwelling controls production during summer months. Bivalves are unlikely to influence material processes except at local bed scales in these systems, although estuary-wide effects could appear as the fraction of cultured area rises or in poorly flushed bays. Bivalve culture clearly modifies estuarine habitat at local community and at landscape scales and effects are most often evaluated against existing structured habitat in the form of submerged aquatic vegetation. Individual activities act as pulse disturbances and the recovery of eelgrass (Zostera marina) to pre-disturbance levels is variable ({\textless} 2 to {\textgreater} 5 years). The extent of disturbance depends on the aquaculture practice and the distribution of eelgrass reflects a balance of space competition, pulse disturbance and recovery, and is therefore at dynamic equilibrium on aquaculture beds. Structure provided by aquaculture appears functionally similar to eelgrass for small benthic infauna and mobile epibenthic fauna while use of aquaculture as habitat by larger more mobile invertebrates and fish depends on mobility and varies with life-history stage and taxon being evaluated. Scale seems a very important management consideration and further research at estuarine landscape scales, especially for habitat use by important invertebrates and fish, may prove useful in designing and implementing best management practices. Though local and short term effects from aquaculture are clearly evident in U.S. West Coast estuaries, bivalve aquaculture does not remove area from the estuary or degrade water quality like other anthropogenic influences, and thus has not been implicated in shifts to alternate states or reduced adaptive capacity of the larger ecological system.},

The overall trends were a positive relation between growth and flow speed for clams, and a negative relation for oysters. A 28-day experiment in summer 1991 tested for the effects of four flow speed levels: 0, 1, 2 and 4 cm s-1. There were substantial and marginally significant differences in shell growth rates for oysters (ANOVA, P = 0.042) and clams (ANOVA, P = 0.063). Growth response patterns were different for the two taxa, with clams showing a consistent positive relation between flow speed and growth (maximal growth at 2 to 4 cm s-1), and oysters showing maximal growth (average three-fold increase over other flow speeds) at 1 cm s-1 with decreased growth at 0 cm s-1 and {\textgreater} 1 cm s-1. We hypothesize that the differences in growth response patterns may be explained by differences in inhalant pumping speeds, with maximal individual growth expected for suspension-feeding bivalves at ambient flow speeds that approximate the inhalant pumping speed. Because siphonate taxa typically have greater inhalant pumping speeds, we predict that ambient flow speeds optimal for individual growth will generally be several cm s-1 greater than those for nonsiphonate taxa. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Resuspension of microphytobenthic biomass that builds up during low tide has been acknowledged as a major driver of the highly productive food web of intertidal mudflats. Yet, little is known about the contribution to pelagic food web of the resuspension of other microorganisms such as viruses, picoeukaryotes, cyanobacteria, bacteria, nanoflagellates, and ciliates, living in biofilms associated with microphytobenthos and surficial sediment. In the present study, a novel approach that involves simultaneous Lagrangian and Eulerian surveys enabled to disentangle the effects of resuspension and mixing with offshore waters on the dynamics of water column microorganisms during a rising tide in the presence of waves. Temporal changes in the concentration of microorganisms present in the water column were recorded along a 3. km cross-shore transect and at a fixed subtidal location. In both surveys, physical and biological processes were separated by comparing the time-evolution of sedimentary particles and microorganism concentrations. During a rising tide, sediment erosion under wave action occurred over the lower and upper parts of the mudflat, where erodibility was highest. Although erosion was expected to enrich the water column with the most abundant benthic microorganisms, such as diatoms, bacteria and viruses, enrichment was only observed for nanoflagellates and ciliates. Grazing probably overwhelmed erosion transfer for diatoms and bacteria, while adsorption on clayed particles may have masked the expected water column enrichment in free viruses due to resuspension. Ciliate enrichment could not be attributed to resuspension as those organisms were absent from the sediment. Wave agitation during the water flow on the mudflat likely dispersed gregarious ciliates over the entire water column. During the rising tide, offshore waters imported more autotrophic, mainly cyanobacteria genus Synechococcus sp. than heterotrophic microorganisms, but this import was also heavily grazed. Finally, the water column became a less heterotrophic structure in the subtidal part of the semi-enclosed bay, where mixing with offshore waters occurs (50{\%} decrease), compared to the intertidal mudflat, when resuspension occurs. The present study suggests that this differential evolution resulted predominantly from dilution with offshore waters less rich in heterotrophic microorganisms. Indeed, any input of microorganisms accompanying physical transfers due to bed erosion or offshore water mixing was immediately buffered, probably to the benefit of grazers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The suspension-feeding Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum is a native species of the western Pacific that is now widely distributed around the globe because of its commercial importance. To determine the adaptive physiological responses to changing thermal and nutritional conditions, clearance, filtration, feces production, ammonium excretion, respiration rates, and scope for growth (SFG) were measured in adult clams. The clams were exposed to 24 treatments involving the combination of four water temperatures (8, 13, 18, and 23°C) and six concentrations of suspended particulatematter (SPM: 9.5 to 350.5 mg L-1). Physiological rates were standardized by using the mean (480 mg) of tissue dry weights of experimental clams using allometric equations between physiological variables and tissue dry weight. Higher clearance rates were recorded at higher temperatures and lower SPM concentrations, and these rates decreased with increasing SPM concentration at individual temperatures. Consumed energy increased with increasing temperature and SPM concentration, peaking at around 100-200 mg L-1 at 18-23°C. Whereas fecal energy was largely determined by SPM concentration, ammonia excretion was mainly governed by temperature. Respiration rate studies revealed a predominant quadratic effect of temperature on the metabolism, indicating a lack of acclimatory adjustment of metabolic rate to rising temperature. SFG values were positive under almost all the treatment conditions and were much higher at higher SPM concentrations ({\textgreater} 45 mg L-1), with the highest level being recorded at 18°C and 100-200 mg L-1 SPM. Increased filtration rate offset the increased metabolic cost at warm temperatures. Our holistic findings suggest that a high degree of physiological plasticity allows R. philippinarum to tolerate the wide range of temperatures and SPM concentrations that are found in tidal flats, accounting in part for the successful distribution of this species over a wide variety of geographical areas.},

The 1970 shipment consisted of 31 otter which were to be released on the southern Oregon Coast near the town of Port Orford. Two of these animals died in holding pens and 29 were successfully released to the wild on 18 July 1970. A second shipment of 64 sea otter was divided into two groups. On 24 June 1971, 24 otter were released at Port Orford and 40 more were released near Cape Arago. Total documented mortality of the translocated sea otter consisted of eight animals, seven of these were found within 1 week of the releases. During the study period reports of sea otter were distributed from Tillamook Head to Brookings, Oregon, a distance of approxi- mately 276 miles. A single report was received from Tolvana Beach, Oregon, 181 miles north of the nearest release site. Concentrations of otter were established at two locations during 1972, Simpson and Blanco reefs. The number of animals that could.be observed at either of these sites seemed to be related to the season, with most otter using Simpson Reef during the winter months, sub- sequently moving to Blanco Reef 35 miles to the south as the weather subsided. The use patterns for 1972-73 were similar to those for 1971-72; however, the number of otter using Simpson Reef during the winter of 1972-73 was less than for the previous winter, suggesting that a portion of the herd may have remained in the vicinity of Cape Blanco during winter 1972-73. It is estimated that 30-35 sea otter were on the coast at the termination of this study (5 October 1973).},

A high resolution (100-m grid), depth-averaged, numerical hydrodynamic model has been imple- mented for San Diego Bay to describe essential tidal hydrodynamic processes in the bay. The model is calibrated using the 1983 data set and verified using the more recent 1992-1996 data. Discrepan- cies between model predictions and field data in both model calibra- tion and verification are on the order of the magnitude of uncertainties in the field data.

abstract = {The Mediterranean Thau Lagoon is an important oyster farming area in Europe. Oyster growth rates are among the highest in France, although chlorophyll a concentration is low. Previous studies have demonstrated that picophytoplankton, nano-microphytoplankton, dinoflagellates and loricate ciliates such as tintinnids are abundant. However, heterotrophic flagellates and aloricate ciliates have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to assess picophytoplankton, protist and zooplankton abundances in the Lagoon and to investigate the particular structure of the microbial food web, which may explain such paradoxical oyster growth. In oligotrophic waters in the Thau Lagoon, the picoeukaryote Ostreococcus tauri is the dominant autotrophic picoplankter, with an abundance maximum in summer. On 17 August 1998, following a rainfall event, pico- and nanophytoplankton abundances were not as high as expected and we observed a high abundance of large diatoms. At this time, the available carbon resources were produced by microphytoplankton (84.5{\%}), and picoplank-tonic cells represented only 1.27 {\%} in terms of carbon. Heterotrophic cells were low in abundance and constituted {\textless}14{\%} of carbon resources. In order to evaluate the importance of the 'protozoan trophic link' for energy transfer from the microbial food web to large benthic suspension feeders, the oyster Crassostrea gigas was offered a planktonic community as potential prey. In the grazing experiment, all {\textgreater}5 mum flagellates, microphytoplankton, dinoflagellates, ciliates and large zooplankton were retained by the oyster gills. Only flagellates {\textless}5 pm and O. tauri were not very well retained (45 and 2{\%} respectively). The high clearance rates of C. gigas found in this experiment can be explained by a low concentration of suspended particulate matter (0.65 mg l(-1)). The oysters adapted their retention mechanism when they Lived in oligotrophic waters. These results indicate that, under the given experimental conditions, picophytoplankton did not represent a valuable trophic resource for farmed oysters because (1) C. gigas cannot retain picoparticles and (2) the picoplankton represented a poor carbon resource capable of being transferred via a weak heterotrophic protist community. In the oyster pens of the Thau Lagoon during this study, microphytoplanktonic primary producers, in particular diatoms, were the main food sources for bivalve suspension feeders},

abstract = {The Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) is a foundation species inhabiting estuaries along the North American west coast. In California estuaries, O. lurida is adapted to local salinity regimes and populations differ in low salinity tolerance. In this study, oysters from three California populations were reared for two generations in a laboratory common garden and subsequently exposed to low salinity seawater. Comparative transcriptomics was then used to understand species-level responses to hyposmotic stress and population-level mechanisms underlying divergent salinity tolerances. Gene expression patterns indicate Olympia oysters are sensitive to hyposmotic stress: All populations respond to low salinity by up-regulating transcripts indicative of protein unfolding, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest after sub-lethal exposure. Among O. lurida populations, transcriptomic profiles differed constitutively and in response to low salinity. Despite two generations in common-garden conditions, transcripts encoding apoptosis modulators were constitutively expressed at significantly different levels in the most tolerant population. Expression of cell death regulators may facilitate cell fate decisions when salinity declines. Following low salinity exposure, oysters from the more tolerant population expressed a small number of mRNAs at significantly higher levels than less tolerant populations. Proteins encoded by these transcripts regulate ciliary activity within the mantle cavity and may function to prolong valve closure and reduce mortality in low salinity seawater. Collectively, gene expression patterns suggest sub-lethal impacts of hyposmotic stress in Olympia oysters are considerable and that even oysters with greater low salinity tolerance may be vulnerable to future freshwater flooding events.},

Degradation of oyster reefs by destructive fishing practices in particular has had a profound effect on estuarine ecology, yet the timing and magnitude of oyster-reef degradation in estuaries is poorly quantified. Here, I evaluate the expansion and collapse of oyster fisheries in 28 estuaries along three continental margins through the analysis of historical proxies derived from fishery records to infer when oyster reefs were degraded. Exploitation for oysters did not occur randomly along continental margins but followed a predictable pattern. Oyster fisheries expanded and collapsed in a linear sequence along eastern North America (Crassostrea virginica), western North America (Ostreola conchaphila), and eastern Australia (Saccostrea glomerata). Fishery collapse began in the estuaries that were nearest to a developing urban center before exploitation began to spread down the coast. As each successive fishery collapsed, oysters from more distant estuaries were fished and transported to restock exploited estuaries near the original urban center. This moving wave of exploitation traveled along each coastline until the most distant estuary had been reached and overfished.},

The potential significance of these interactions, which take place at a microscale level of millimetres to metres, for the large-scale geomorphology of the seabed has rarely been appreciated. In the context of this review, large-scale is defined as greater than 50 m to hundreds of kilometres. The present review addresses this link, drawing examples from a wide range of marine environments, including estuaries, the intertidal zone, continental shelves and slopes, and the deep sea. It firstly considers sediment stabilisation, slope failure, sediment mixing, biodeposition, sediment compaction, and hydrodynamic effects. This is followed by a consideration of two extremes of the ecological pyramid-the effects of marine meiofauna and marine vertebrates. The final section draws attention to the central role of faunal mucus and extracellular polymeric material (ECPM) in many of the microscale interactions that we describe. The implications of these microscale biological processes and features are discussed in terms of their influence on and control of the large-scale geomorphology of the seabed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Crassostrea virginica, the eastern oyster, is a filter-feeding bivalve currently found at low numbers in Chesapeake Bay. Accurately modeling the particles removed from the water column by feeding is important for determining the impact oysters have on water quality and can be a tool for planning restoration. Upon thorough assessment of three oyster models, each incorporating a filtration rate formulation, I established a new filtration rate model that is dependent on individual size and the environmental limitations of salinity, temperature, and suspended solids. This equation was then coupled with two particle models, each designed to account for the gradient of particles across a reef with varying degrees of complexity. The model including both advection and diffusion resulted in a better depiction of reef particle gradients. I used steady-state solutions over a range of conditions to determine that oyster reefs in lower velocity environments with high oyster densities are more susceptible to food limitation.},

abstract = {The effects of climate change, including ocean acidification and ocean heatwaves, on biological communities in estuaries are often uncertain. Part of the uncertainty is due to the complex suite of environmental factors in addition to acidification and warming that influence the growth of shells and skeletons of many estuarine organisms. The goal of this study was to document spatial and temporal variation in water column properties and to measure the in situ effects on larval and recently settled stages of ecologically important Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) and commercially important Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) in a low-inflow estuary with a Mediterranean climate in Northern California. Our results reveal that seasonal inputs of upwelled or riverine water create important and predictable gradients of carbonate system parameters, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and other variables that influence oyster performance, and that the influence of these gradients is contingent upon the location in the estuary as well as seasonal timing. During upwelling events (dry season), temperature, carbonate chemistry, and DO had the greatest impact on oyster performance. During runoff events (wet season), gradients in salinity, nutrient concentrations, and total alkalinity driven by river discharge were comparatively more important. These results suggest that the spatial importance of carbonate chemistry and temperature are seasonally variable and are two of several other factors that determine oyster performance. We use these results to discuss future impacts on oysters given projected regional changes in the frequency and magnitude of upwelling and precipitation-driven runoff events.},

abstract = {Worldwide, artificially armored shorelines can dominate available estuarine habitat. Increases in artificial substrata in southern California, USA, coincide with increased abundances of nonindigenous species. The US west coast Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, may be particularly sensitive to changes in natural habitat availability and recently experienced large-scale declines in abundance. Simultaneously, the non-indigenous and often invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, has been introduced along the US West Coast, including into southern California estuaries where its impact is unstudied. We recorded C. gigas and O. lurida densities from October 2010 through July 2017 throughout southern California on several habitat types and as a function of tidal elevation as a critical baseline for evaluating impacts of C. gigas. Ostrea lurida was present in higher proportions than C. gigas in hard substrate-dominated habitats, whether natural or human-introduced. A strong zonation pattern emerged; C. gigas achieved its maximum density above +0.4 m MLLW versus O. lurida at or below +0.2 m MLLW. These data reveal the optimal tidal elevation for placement of a restored O. lurida bed and establish a critical baseline and techniques for evaluating future changes in oyster density.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Although sustained predominantly by nutrients obtained directly from the environment, metabolic requirements for both gametogenesis and general maintenance in an open-shore population of the bivalve mollusc Mytilus edulis L. from southwest England were also 'subsidized' from substantial energy reserves accumulated during periods of somatic growth. Depletion of these reserves over late winter was associated with a greater sensitivity in the rate of oxidative metabolism to exogenous nutrient availability, diminished metabolic efficiencies with which absorbed ration was utilized, and an associated increase in the instantaneous maintenance requirements. Absorption rates, which were nevertheless minimal during winter, are suggested to be endogenously regulated in a manner more indicative of time-averaged than immediate optimization. It is proposed that such regulation may be especially adaptive within M. edulis, a sedentary species that experiences pronounced annual cycles of food availability, and in which costs deriving from feeding and associated activities are shown to add as much as 38 {\%} to standard metabolic demands.},

abstract = {Conservation paleobiology aims to apply data from geohistorical records, such as fossils and their associated sediments, to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Integrating geohistorical data into conservation/restoration practice, however, has proved difficult. To better understand how geohistorical data can be more effectively integrated into the conservation/restoration of an ecologically, economically, and culturally important group—oysters—a web-based survey was conducted to assess the awareness and understanding of geohistorical data and perspectives on their use in restoration among oyster researchers and restoration practitioners in the United States. The 97 survey responses not only demonstrate overall willingness to use geohistorical data in oyster restoration but also highlight knowledge gaps. For instance, although many respondents understood some uses for geohistorical data, e.g., providing baseline information, few respondents mentioned others, such as reconstructing historical ranges of variation of ecosystem attributes. Respondents were also generally not aware of the full range of restoration metrics that can be measured from geohistorical records. The responses further suggested how geohistorical information might both reinforce and expand the information currently available to oyster restoration professionals. For instance, only half of respondents indicated that their baseline information predates the 20th century, but geohistorical records of oysters can provide data on timescales ranging from decades to millennia. Finally, it is argued that to raise awareness of this underutilized information and address respondents' doubts about the completeness, precision/accuracy, and relevance of geohistorical data in a rapidly changing, human-dominated world, increased collaboration between conservation paleobiologists and conservation/restoration scientists is needed.},

abstract = {Responsiveness and resilience to coastal disasters is an increasingly critical need for governments, businesses, and communities as the intensity of hurricanes, coastal storms and sea level rise exacerbates flood and erosion damages. The number and severity of disasters have increased significantly over the past two decades while intense coastal development has steadily degraded the protective and other ecosystem benefits from natural habitats such as coral reefs, mangroves and seagrasses. Such ecosystems can provide cost-effective, long-term risk reduction and other benefits to coastal communities. Yet easy, low-cost methodologies for incorporating such natural capital values into metrics that can inform policy and investment decisions have been lacking until recently. Whereas new approaches and studies have developed ways to quantify and assess such risk reduction benefits, finding the data to assess such services in data poor environments, both for regional and local scales, remains challenging. This paper outlines how breakthroughs in data technologies can help with incorporating ecosystem benefits into real-world policy and investment applications. Specific new data and analytical technologies are increasingly being used to quantify coastal risk reduction and other ecosystem benefits. We review several case studies where ecosystem benefits were quantified based on new data technologies and used for policy and investment strategies to improve a broader suite of ecosystem benefits to coastal communities. Equipping public and private sector actors with cost-effective and accessible approaches and tools to incorporate nature-based solutions into disaster risk management and coastal zone management planning more generally can transform climate resilience strategies around the world.},

Such filters can be used for further investigations in microscopic or chromatographic (for example High-Performance-Liquid-Chromatography, HPLC) methods, while the filtrates can be used for nutrient or fluorometric measurements as well as for microscopic examinations. Which filter is chosen for a study often depends on its pore size, the costs and, in particular for HPLC measurements, on its chemical compatibility. In our study we compared the chlorophyll-a retention on the filters by HPLC as well as the fluorescence before and after filtration, and nutrient content of the filtrates. The filters we tested were of different material and with various pore sizes. Although Whatman GF/C and GF/F filters are preferred in phytoplankton studies, we found that the Nylon Membrane filter of 0.2 $\mu$m pore size provided the most consistent results in chlorophyll-a retention and the one of 0.45 $\mu$m pore size in nutrient investigations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {It is well known that ocean acidification can have profound impacts on marine organisms. However, we know little about the direct and indirect effects of ocean acidification and also how these effects interact with other features of environmental change such as warming and declining consumer pressure. In this study, we tested whether the presence of consumers (invertebrate mesograzers) influenced the interactive effects of ocean acidification and warming on benthic microalgae in a seagrass community mesocosm experiment. Net effects of acidification and warming on benthic microalgal biomass and production, as assessed by analysis of variance, were relatively weak regardless of grazer presence. However, partitioning these net effects into direct and indirect effects using structural equation modeling revealed several strong relationships. In the absence of grazers, benthic microalgae were negatively and indirectly affected by sediment-associated microalgal grazers and macroalgal shading, but directly and positively affected by acidification and warming. Combining indirect and direct effects yielded no or weak net effects. In the presence of grazers, almost all direct and indirect climate effects were nonsignificant. Our analyses highlight that (i) indirect effects of climate change may be at least as strong as direct effects, (ii) grazers are crucial in mediating these effects, and (iii) effects of ocean acidification may be apparent only through indirect effects and in combination with other variables (e.g., warming). These findings highlight the importance of experimental designs and statistical analyses that allow us to separate and quantify the direct and indirect effects of multiple climate variables on natural communities.},

abstract = {The California oyster industry is an interesting example of man's adapting an otherwise unproductive part of the landscape to his benefit. His efforts to raise exotic oyster species on barren, tidal mud-flats along a coast where there is no native oyster stock of commercial value have met with both success and failure, and the industry has been marked by wide fluctuations in activity over its 110-year history. California was the leading Pacific coast oyster producer during the latter 19th century, followed closely by Washington. Production in Oregon was comparatively insignificant. After the decline early in this century of the San Francisco Bay oyster industry based on young oysters imported from the east coast, the California industry had a marginal existence until a major revival of the industry in the mid-1950's. At that time, large-scale plantings of young oysters imported from Japan, raised California oyster production to a level similar to that achieved in the late 19th century. By volume of production, California in 1958 was second ranking oyster producer on the Pacific coast, and seventh ranked among all United States oyster producing states. The latter rank was due to declining production on the east coast as well as to increased production in California. Two general accounts of California's oyster industry development have been published. One was by Charles Townsend (1893), who visited the oyster growing area of San Francisco Bay a number of times during the late 1880's in the course of his work aboard the United States Bureau of Fisheries' steamer Albatross. The other account was by Paul Bonnot (1935), California Division of Fish and Game, whose principal contribution was a description of developments in the industry in the 1930's connected with introducing Pacific oysters from Japan and the attempt to establish a native oyster industry. There appears to be no published account of the California oyster industry covering its entire history and utilizing all the scattered materials relating to the subject, particularly to its current condition. I have attempted to supply such an account in this paper.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are increasingly recognized as essential elements within coastal defence schemes and coastal adaptation. The capacity of coastal ecosystems, like marshes and oyster reefs, to maintain their own habitat and grow with sea-level rise via biophysical feedbacks is seen as an important advantage of such systems compared to man-made hard engineering structures.Providing a suitable substrate for oysters to settle on offers a kick-start for establishment at places where they were lost or are desirable for coastal protection. Accumulation of shell material, through recruitment and growth, is essential to the maintenance of oyster reefs as it provides substrate for new generations (positive feedback loop), forming a self-sustainable structure. Insight in establishment, survival and growth thresholds and knowledge about the population dynamics are necessary to successfully implement oyster reefs in coastal defence schemes.The aim of this paper is to investigate whether artificial Pacific oyster reefs develop into self-sustaining oyster reefs that contribute to coastal protection. Reef development was investigated by studying recruitment, survival and growth rates of oysters on artificial oyster reefs in comparison with nearby natural Pacific oyster reefs. The artificial reef structure successfully offered substrate for settlement of oysters and therefore stimulated reef formation. Reef development, however, was hampered by local sedimentation and increasing tidal emersion. Tidal emersion is an important factor that can be used to predict where artificial oyster reefs have the potential to develop into self-sustaining reefs that could contribute to coastal protection, but it is also a limiting factor in using oyster reefs for coastal protection.},

abstract = {1. Trade-offs between competitive ability and tolerance of abiotic stress are widespread in the literature. Thus, condition-specific competition may explain spatial variability in the success of some biological invaders and why, in environments where there is small-scale environmental variability, competitively inferior and superior species can coexist. 2. We tested the hypothesis that differences in abiotic stress alter the outcome of competitive interactions between the native Sydney rock oysters Saccostrea glomerata and exotic Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas by experimentally testing patterns of intra- and interspecific competition across a tidal elevation gradient of abiotic stress at three sites on the east coast of Australia. 3. At low and mid-intertidal heights, exotic C. gigas were able to rapidly overgrow and smother native S. glomerata, which grew at c. 60{\%} of the exotic's rate. In high intertidal areas, where C. gigas displayed about 80{\%} mortality but similar growth rates to S. glomerata, the native oyster was not affected by the presence of the exotic species. 4. Asymmetrical effects of the exotic species on the native could not be replicated by manipulating densities of conspecifics, confirming that effects at low and mid-intertidal heights were due to interspecific competition. 5. Our results suggest that the more rapid growth of C. gigas than S. glomerata comes at the cost of higher mortality under conditions of abiotic stress. Thus, although C. gigas may rapidly overgrow S. glomerata at low and mid tidal heights, the native oyster will not be competitively excluded by the exotic due to release from competition at high intertidal elevations. 6. The success of trade-offs in explaining spatial variation in the outcome of competitive interactions between C. gigas and S. glomerata strengthen the claim that these may be a useful tool in the quest to produce general predictive models of invasion success.},

The upper concentration is equivalent to that occurring during the spring phytoplankton blooms. Ingestion rates varied between 81.6 $\mu$g AFDW h-1 for the mussels fed on the lowest concentration, 191.2 $\mu$g AFDW h-1 when the concentration rose to 0.4mg AFDW L-1, and 164.0 $\mu$g AFDW h-1 for the highest concentration. Food concentration had a significant effect on absorption efficiency, which was approximately 70{\%} at the intermediate and upper concentrations, but rose to over 80{\%} at the lowest concentration. The food absorption rate varied with food concentration in a manner similar to that of the ingestion rate, i.e., with a maximum value of 142.34 $\mu$g AFDW h-1 for the mussels fed on the intermediate concentration, this being higher than the values for both the highest concentration (114.72 $\mu$g AFDW h-1) and the lowest (65.89 $\mu$g AFDW h-1). Respiration rates were 54 $\mu$g O2 h-1 for the mussels fed on the lowest concentration and 74 $\mu$g O2 h-1 for those fed on the intermediate concentration. These results show a close relationship between respiration and ingestion rates, which can be fitted to the following equation: RR=e(0.42+0.101R) (r=0.5703, R2 = 32.53, p {\textless}0.01). Scope for growth (SFG) estimations were higher for those mussels fed at the intermediate and upper concentrations (1.95 J h-1 and 1.50 J h-1, respectively), between which no significant difference was observed (p {\textgreater} 0.05), whilst SFG for the lowest food concentration was only 0.69 J h-1. The physiological rate with the greatest effect on growth was the absorption rate. Its relation to SFG is described by the equation SFG = 0.67 + 0.90AR (r = 0.977, R2=95.56{\%}, p{\textless}0.01). The discussion of these results is based on the growth rates that have been described for this mussel in its natural environment where habitat structure, such as the canopy provided by the eelgrass, can affect the success of the invasive mussel.},

Moreover, field surveys of more than 8000 reef-building corals located adjacent to seagrass meadows showed twofold reductions in disease levels compared to corals at paired sites without adjacent seagrass meadows. These results highlight the importance of seagrass ecosystems to the health of humans and other organisms.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the responses of the oyster Crassostrea gigas to oxygen levels at subcellular and whole organism levels. Two experiments were carried out. The first experiment was designed to measure the clearance and oxygen consumption rates of oysters exposed at different concentrations of oxygen at 15, 20 and 25°C for 20 h. The goal of this first part was to estimate the hypoxic threshold for oysters below which their metabolism shifts towards anaerobiosis, by estimating the oxygen critical point (PcO2) at 15, 20 and 25°C. The second experiment was carried out to evaluate the metabolic adaptations to hypoxia for 20 days at three temperatures: 12, 15 and 20°C. The metabolic pathways were characterized by the measurement of the enzymes pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the alanine and succinate content and the adenylate energy charge. Respiratory chain functioning was estimated by the measurement of the activity of the electron transport system (ETS). The values of PcO2 were 3.02±0.15, 3.43±0.20 and 3.28±0.24 mg O2 l-1 at 15, 20 and 25°C, respectively. In whole oysters, hypoxia involved the inhibition of PK whatever the temperature, but PEPCK was not stimulated. Succinate accumulated significantly only at 12°C and alanine at 12 and 15°C. A negative relationship between the PK activity and the alanine content was only found in hypoxic oysters. Finally, hypoxia increased significantly the activity of ETS. With high PcO2 values, the metabolic depression occurred quickly, showing that oysters had a low capacity to regulate their respiration when oxygen availability is reduced, particularly in the summer.},

abstract = {Conservation biologists and other environmentalists confront five obstacles in building support for regulatory policies that seek to exclude or remove introduced plants and other non-native species that threaten to harm natural areas or the natural environment. First, the concept of “harm to the natural environment” is nebulous and undefined. Second, ecologists cannot predict how introduced species will behave in natural ecosystems. If biologists cannot define “harm” or predict the behavior of introduced species, they must target all non-native species as potentially “harmful”. an impossibly large regulatory task. Third, loss of species richness may constitute harm to an environment, but introduced organisms typically, generally, and significantly add to species richness in ecosystems. If species richness correlates with desirable ecosystem properties, moreover, such as stability and productivity, as some ecologists believe, then introduced organisms, by increasing species richness, would support those desirable properties. Fourth, one may plausibly argue that extinction constitutes environmental harm, but there is no evidence that non-native species, especially plants, are significant causes of extinction, except for predators in certain lakes and other small island-like environments. Fifth, while aesthetic, ethical, and spiritual values may provide a legitimate basis for invasive species policy, biologists often cite concepts such as “biodiversity” and ecosystem “health” or “integrity” to provide a scientific justification. To assert that non-native species threaten biodiversity or undermine ecosystem health, however, may be to draw conceptual entailments or consequences from definitions of “biodiversity” and “integrity” that arbitrarily exclude non-native species or make the presence of exotic species a per se indicator of decline.},

abstract = {Oyster reefs form over extensive areas and the diversity and productivity of sheltered coasts depend on them. Due to the relatively recent population growth of coastal settlements in Australia, we were able to evaluate the collapse and extirpation of native oyster reefs (Ostrea angasi) over the course of a commercial fishery. We used historical records to quantify commercial catch of O. angasi in southern Australia from early colonization, around 1836, to some of the last recorded catches in 1944 and used our estimates of catch and effort to map their past distribution and assess oyster abundance over 180 years. Significant declines in catch and effort occurred from 1886 to 1946 and no native oyster reefs occur today, but historically oyster reefs extended across more than 1,500 km of coastline. That oyster reefs were characteristic of much of the coastline of South Australia from 1836 to 1910 appears not to be known because there is no contemporary consideration of their ecological and economic value. Based on the concept of a shifted baseline, we consider this contemporary state to reflect a collective, intergenerational amnesia. Ourmodel of generational amnesia accounts for differences in intergenerational expectations of food, economic value, and ecosystem services of nearshore areas. An ecological system that once surrounded much of the coast and possibly the past presence of oyster reefs altogethermay be forgotten and could not only undermine progress towards their recovery, but also reduce our expectations of these coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: South San Francisco Bay, USA, is a shallow coastal embayment that receives large inputs of nutrients (N. P, Si) and small local inputs of freshwater. Phytoplankton dynamics are typically characterized by a spring bloom when surface chlorophyll a increases from {\textless} 5 to {\textgreater} 40 mg m-3. The bloom persists for 2 to 4 wk, and then dissipates. Phytoplankton biomass remains low (chlorophyll a {\textless} 5 mg m-3) from May through December, although light and nutrient availability are sufficient to sustain growth rates of 1 to 1.5 divisions d-' in the expansive shallows. Transport processes apparently exert a small influence on phytoplankton biomass, and calculated zooplankton grazing accounts for only a small reduction in net rate of phytoplankton population growth in the shallows. However, suspension-feeding bivalves are sufficiently abundant to filter a volume equivalent to the volume of South Bay at least once daily. These observations suggest that grazing by benthos is the primary mechanism},

abstract = {There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that bivalve molluscs routinely ingest zooplankton. To elucidate further these observations, a 15-month study of zooplankton ingestion by farmed mussels was conducted using mussel long-lines in Bantry Bay, Ireland. Stomach content analysis of the mussels showed that there was evidence of zooplankton ingestion throughout the sampling period, but that highest mean numbers of zooplankters were ingested by mussels in the spring and summer months. Various zooplankton species were present in mussel stomachs. Harpacticoid copepods were found more often in stomach contents than calanoid copepods, probably due to their proximity to the bivalves' inhalent siphons. Barnacle cyprids featured in large numbers in stomach contents, but only for a period of 3 months which broadly corresponded with their pelagic phase. Sizes of ingested zooplankton ranged from 126 $\mu$m to 6 mm, but more of the smaller zooplankters (e.g. crustacean nauplii) were ingested. When lengths of ingested copepods were compared with those found in plankton net samples, it was found that the net-sampled copepods were significantly larger than those found in mussel stomachs, suggesting that mussels select for smaller categories within the zooplankton available to them. Soft bodied zooplankton was rarely found in mussel stomachs but their absence may be due to rapid digestion or they may have been destroyed in the preservation process. Ingestion of zooplankton by bivalves is discussed in the context of the impacts mussel farms have on resident zooplankton populations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Kimbro2009,
abstract = {Here we empirically demonstrate that a tidal exchange gradient in a central California estuary leads to inversely related spatial gradients in upwelled nutrients and water residence times. As a result, seasonal phytoplankton blooms (summer-fall) occur in the middle of the bay, where nutrient levels and water residence times are intermediate, while seasonal temperature maximums occur in the inner bay, where water residence times are highest and nutrient levels are lowest. By experimentally out-planting juvenile Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) throughout the estuary, we found that the growth and size of juvenile oysters are better explained by the spatial pattern of phytoplankton concentrations than by that of water temperature. Furthermore, this benthic-pelagic link helps explain the distribution of adult oyster sizes throughout the estuary. Because a phytoplankton maximum can be maintained by a physical interaction between intensive upwelling and a seasonal low-inflow estuary, benthic invertebrates within protected embayments of upwelling regions may not conform to the regional generalization that their growth and size are negatively correlated with upwelling intensity. {\textcopyright} 2009, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Improved management approaches are needed to reduce the rate at which humans are depleting exploited marine populations and degrading marine ecosystems. Networks of no-take marine reserves are promising management tools because of their potential to (1) protect coastal ecosystem structure and functioning, (2) benefit exploited populations and fisheries, (3) improve scientific understanding of marine ecosystems, and (4) provide enriched opportunities for non-extractive human activities. By protecting marine ecosystems and their populations, no-take reserve networks can reduce risk by providing important insurance for fishery managers against overexploitation of individual populations. Replicated reserves also foster strong scientific testing of fishery and conservation management strategies. Reserve networks will require social acceptance, adequate enforcement, and effective scientific evaluation to be successful. Processes for reserve establishment should accommodate adaptive management so boundaries and regulations can be modified to enhance performance. However, even well-designed reserve networks will require continued conservation efforts outside reserve boundaries to be effective. Establishing networks of no-take reserves is a process-oriented, precautionary management strategy that protects functional attributes of marine ecosystems. As an addition to fishery management practices and other conservation efforts, no-take reserve networks may improve the status of exploited populations while conserving marine resources for future generations.},

abstract = {Reefs and beds formed by oysters such as the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica and the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida Carpenter 1864† were dominant features in many estuaries throughout their native ranges. Many of these estuaries no longer have healthy, productive reefs because of impacts from destructive fishing, sediment accumulation, pollution, and parasites. Once valued primarily as a fishery resource, increasing attention is being focused today on the array of other ecosystem services that oysters and the reefs they form provide in United States coastal bays and estuaries. Since the early 1990s efforts to restore subtidal and intertidal oyster reefs have increased significantly, with particular interest in small-scale community-based projects initiated most often by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). To date, such projects have been undertaken in at least 15 US states, for both species of dominant native oysters along the United States coast. Community-based restoration practitioners have used a broad range of nonmutually exclusive approaches, including: (1) oyster gardening of hatchery-produced oysters; (2) deployment of juvenile to adult shellfish (‘‘broodstock'') within designated areas for stock enhancement; and (3) substrate enhancement using natural or recycled man-made materials loose or in ‘‘bags'' designed to enhance local settlement success. Many of these approaches are inspired by fishery-enhancement efforts of the past, though are implemented with different outcomes in mind (ecological services vs. fishery outcomes). This paper was originally presented at the first West Coast Restoration Workshop in 2006 in San Rafael, California and is intended to summarize potential approaches for small-scale restoration projects, including some emerging methods, and highlight the logistical benefits and limitations of these approaches. Because the majority of the past efforts have been with C. viriginica, we use those examples initially to highlight efforts with the intent of enlightening current west coast United States efforts with Ostrea lurida. We also discuss site-specific characteristics including ‘‘recruitment bottlenecks'' and ‘‘substrate limitation'' as criteria for identifying the most appropriate approaches to use for small-scale restoration projects. Many of the included ‘‘lessons-learned'' from the smaller-scale restoration projects being implemented today can be used to inform not only large-scale estuary wide efforts to restore C. virginica, but also the relatively nascent efforts directed at restoring the United States west coast's native Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida.},

abstract = {We tested a model of clearance rate regulation that specifies that clearance rate is driven by the density of energy reserves and is modulated by factors such as biochemical signalling and seston concentration (Fr{\'{e}}chette, M. 2012. A model of clearance rate regulation in mussels. J. Sea Res. 73:32-40). Mussels were fed natural seston at high and low concentrations for 71 days to manipulate the density of energy reserves ("position effect"). Clearance rate of each group was assayed in a two-level repeated-measures design experiment, within and among days. The effect of position and its interactions was not significant. It is likely that the low seston level treatment was too mild to generate phenotypic flexibility in clearance rate. The effect of time, however, was significant at all scales. Seston variability allowed examining the functional response of mean clearance rate to seston level. Short-term clearance rate was bounded by seston concentration at very low and high seston concentration. Between concentration extremes, however, short-term clearance rate was not regulated by actual seston concentration. On some occasions hysteresis dominated the functional response, implying delayed regulation, presumably in response to gut fullness. Hourly-averaged mean clearance rate exhibited a clearly-defined non monotonous response to seston level. Therefore we modified the initial model formulation in order to include the effect of low seston level. We found an excellent fit between the modified model and the data. Therefore, in spite of appearing erratic at intermediate seston level, short-term clearance rate patterns are embedded within a well-defined functional response. Understanding these patterns apparently requires that seston level, its temporal variability and the dynamics of gut fullness be taken into account.},

abstract = {Ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) are ubiquitous intertidal invertebrates of eastern North American salt marshes, often living in close association with salt marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. They are typically concentrated at the lower extent of the vegetated zone along tidal channels, but are also found across the marsh platform. As filter-feeding bivalves, ribbed mussels remove suspended micro-particulate matter and associated nutrients from the water column, potentially resulting in benefits to water quality. However, the magnitude of such ecosystem services may depend on temporal and spatial variation in the mussel's water clearance and particle filtration rates. The goal of this study was to identify sources of variation regarding the distribution of ribbed mussel filtration services. Seasonal-spring, summer, and fall- water clearance and particle filtration rates were quantified for ribbed mussels collected from three habitats- low marsh along main tidal channels; low marsh along intra-marsh creek networks; and from the high marsh- and replicated in four representative marshes- three in New Jersey and one in Rhode Island, USA, normalized by mussel dry tissue biomass. Clearance rates varied with seasonal temperatures, but exhibited low spatial variability among habitats and marshes, highlighting the importance of understanding the temporal physiological variability when calculating annual rates. In contrast, filtration rates were highly variable, driven largely by spatial variation in seston availability. Annual bulk filtration services provided by ribbed mussels are therefore largely driven by both temporal variability in water processing and spatial variations in food availability, and can therefore be predicted by integrating seasonal clearance rates and site-specific seston composition.},

abstract = {The introduction of non-native species represents unprecedented large-scale experiments that allow us to examine ecological systems in ways that would otherwise not be possible. Invasion by novel ecological types into a community can press a system beyond the bounds normally seen and can reveal community interactions, local drivers and limits within systems that are otherwise hidden by coevolution and a long evolutionary history among local players, as well as local adaptation of species. The success of many invaders is attributed to their ability to thrive in a wide range of habitat types and physical conditions, setting the stage for direct examination of ecological impacts of a species across a range of habitat and community contexts. Bivalves are well-known ecosystem engineers, especially oysters, which are the target of wild-caught fisheries and aquaculture. The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is grown worldwide for aquaculture, and is presently invading shores on virtually every continent. As a consequence, this non-native species is having large impacts on many systems, but the types of impacts are system specific, and greatly depend on substrate type, how physiologically stressful the environment is for intertidal zone species, and the presence of native engineering species. A novel type of engineering effect is identified for this non-native species, whereby it alters not only the physical environment, but also the thermal environment of the community it invades. The impacts of engineering by this non-native species will depend not only on whether it facilitates or inhibits species but also on the trophic level and ecological role of the species affected, and whether similar ecological types are found within the system.},

abstract = {The unique alpine-living kea parrot Nestor notabilis has been the focus of numerous cognitive studies, but its communication system has so far been largely neglected. We examined 2,884 calls recorded in New Zealand's Southern Alps. Based on audio and visual spectrographic differences, these calls were categorised into seven distinct call types: the non-oscillating 'screech' contact call and 'mew'; and the oscillating 'trill', 'chatter', 'warble' and 'whistle'; and a hybrid 'screech-trill'. Most of these calls contained aspects that were individually unique, in addition to potentially encoding for an individual's sex and age. Additionally, for each recording, the sender's previous and next calls were noted, as well as any response given by conspecifics. We found that the previous and next calls made by the sender were most often of the same type, and that the next most likely preceding and/or following call type was the screech call, a contact call which sounds like the 'kee-ah' from which the bird's name derives. As a social bird capable of covering large distances over visually obstructive terrain, long distance contact calls may be of considerable importance for social cohesion. Contact calls allow kea to locate conspecifics and congregate in temporary groups for social activities. The most likely response to any given call was a screech, usually followed by the same type of call as the initial call made by the sender, although responses differed depending on the age of the caller. The exception was the warble, the kea's play call, to which the most likely response was another warble. Being the most common call type, as well as the default response to another call, it appears that the 'contagious' screech contact call plays a central role in kea vocal communication and social cohesion. {\textcopyright} 2012 Current Zoology.},

When a measurand, y, is calculated from other measurements through a functional relationship, uncertainties in the input variables will propagate through the calculation to an uncertainty in the output y. The manner in which such uncertainties are propagated through a functional relationship provides much of the mathematical challenge to fully understanding the GUM. The aim of this review is to provide a general overview of the GUM and to show how the calculation of uncertainty in the measurand may be achieved through a functional relationship. That is, starting with the general equation for combining uncertainty components as outlined in the GUM, we show how this general equation can be applied to various functional relationships in order to derive a combined standard uncertainty for the output value of the particular function (the measurand). The GUM equation may be applied to any mathematical form or functional relationship (the starting point for laboratory calculations) and describes the propagation of uncertainty from the input variable(s) to the output value of the function (the end point or outcome of the laboratory calculation). A rule-based approach is suggested with a number of the more common rules tabulated for the routine calculation of measurement uncertainty.},

Maximum reported sizeis 90 mm diameter, although most individuals are less than 60 mm. Maximum age is unknown, but could be {\textgreater} 10 years. In British Columbia, first maturity is generally achieved one year after settlement. Olympias are larviparous, protandrous, alternating hermaphrodites. Individuals mature first as males, then alternate between male and female phases throughout their lifetime. Fecundity is approximately 250,000-300,000 larvae per spawning. Larvae are retained in the parental mantly cavity for approximately 2 weeks, then are planktonic for 2-4 more weeksd. Larvae settle preferentially on the under surface of hard substrates. In British Columbia, brooding occurs from mid-May to July and settlement occurs from July to September. Dispersal is limited to the planktonic larval phase, once set the adults are sessile. Three to four years growth are required to reach 35-45 mm in size, and little growth occurs after 5 years.},

abstract = {Foundation species in space-limited systems can increase diversity by creating habitat, but they may also reduce diversity by excluding primary space competitors. These contrasting forces of increasing associate diversity and suppressing competitor diversity have rarely been examined experimentally with respect to disturbance. In a benthic marine community in central California, where native oysters are a foundation species, we tested how disturbance influenced overall species richness, evenness, and diversity. Surprisingly, overall diversity did not peak across a disturbance gradient because, as disturbance decreased, decreases in overall species evenness opposed increases in overall species richness. Decreasing disturbance intensity (high oyster abundance) led to increasing species richness of sessile and mobile species combined. This increase was due to the facilitation of secondary sessile and mobile species in the presence of oysters. In contrast, decreasing disturbance intensity and high oyster abundance decreased the evenness of sessile and mobile species. Three factors likely contributed to this decreased evenness: oysters reduced abundances of primary sessile species due to space competition; oysters supported more rare mobile species; and oysters disproportionately increased the relative abundance of a few common mobile species. Our results highlight the need for further studies on how disturbance can differentially affect the evenness and richness of different functional groups, and ultimately how these differences affect the relationship between overall diversity and ecosystem function. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotopes were used to characterize the food webs (i.e., sources of carbon and trophic status of consumers) in Tijuana Estuary and San Dieguito Lagoon. Producer groups were most clearly differentiated by carbon, then by sulfur, and least clearly by nitrogen isotope measurements. Consumer 15N isotopic enrichment suggested that there are four trophic levels in the Tijuana Estuary food web and three in San Dieguito Lagoon. A significant difference in multiple isotope ratio distributions of fishes between wetlands suggested that the food web of San Dieguito Lagoon is less complex than that of Tijuana Estuary. Associations among sources and consumers indicated that inputs from intertidal macroalgae, marsh microalgae, and Spartina foliosa provide the organic matter that supports invertebrates, fishes, and the light-footed clapper tail (Rallus longirostris levipes). These three producers occupy tidal channels, low salt marsh, and mid salt marsh habitats. The only consumer sampled that appears dependent upon primary productivity from high salt marsh habitat is the sora (Porzana carolina). Two- and three-source mixing models identified Spartina as the major organic matter source of fishes, and macroalgae for invertebrates and the light-footed clapper rail in Tijuana Estuary.

@article{Larson2005,
abstract = {Biologists need to continuously reflect upon the ethical and rhetorical dimensions of their language when communicating about invasive species. In particular, is current language likely to promote social cohesion and, consequently, effective and appropriate action towards invasive species? To address this question, I focus on prevailing militaristic and combative metaphors within invasion biology. I argue that these metaphors are problematic because (1) they lead to an inaccurate perception of invasive species; (2) they contribute to social misunderstanding, charges of xenophobia, and loss of scientific credibility; and (3) they reinforce militaristic patterns of thought that are counterproductive for conservation. Therefore, while these metaphors may effec- tively motivate conservation action in the short term, they could be ineffective in the long term. Alternatives to militarism will better promote realistic management and conservation goals in a multicultural context.},

abstract = {The structure of the benthic boundary layer over a bed of mussels (Mytilus edulis) was investigated in a large racetrack flume. Flow was observed to be modified both by the physical roughness of the mussel bed and by the momentum input of the exhalent jets of the mussels. Particularly when the mussels were closed, and filtering activity was reduced to a minimum, we observed an internal boundary layer, around 4 cm thick, within the log layer. This internal boundary layer was often masked when the mussels were filtering actively. The presence of an internal boundary layer indicates that the boundary layer is not only structured by friction drag, but that form drag due to roughness elements also plays an important role. Consequently, estimates of bed shear stress based on velocity or Reynolds stress measurements carried out more than a few cm above the bed may be inaccurate. Over inactive mussels the shear velocity in the internal boundary layer (the roughness sub-layer) is smaller and bed shear stress is consequently reduced. Filtration activity of the mussels increased the velocity gradient in the lower layer at low and intermediate velocities, but at higher flow rates velocity profiles were not affected. Clear effects of the exhalent jets on absolute levels of TKE could be measured at all ambient velocities, while the effect on the Reynolds stress was limited. Velocity normalised TKE and Reynolds stress also indicated that the effect of the siphonal currents was limited at high velocities. Our results indicate that mussel filtration activity may have an important effect on exchange processes at the sediment-water interface, but that the extent of the effect is highly dependent on the ambient flow conditions. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Bible2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the Ecological Society of America The effects of climate-driven stressors on organismal performance and ecosystem functioning have been investigated across many systems; however, manipulative experiments generally apply stressors as constant and simultaneous treatments, rather than accurately reflecting temporal patterns in the natural environment. Here, we assessed the effects of temporal patterns of high aerial temperature and low salinity on survival of Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida), a foundation species of conservation and restoration concern. As single stressors, low salinity (5 and 10 psu) and the highest air temperature (40°C) resulted in oyster mortality of 55.8, 11.3, and 23.5{\%}, respectively. When applied on the same day, low salinity and high air temperature had synergistic negative effects that increased oyster mortality. This was true even for stressor levels that were relatively mild when applied alone (10 psu and 35°C). However, recovery times of two or four weeks between stressors eliminated the synergistic effects. Given that most natural systems threatened by climate change are subject to multiple stressors that vary in the timing of their occurrence, our results suggest that it is important to examine temporal variation of stressors in order to more accurately understand the possible biological responses to global change.},

@article{Lillis2013,
abstract = {Following a planktonic dispersal period of days to months, the larvae of benthic marine organisms must locate suitable seafloor habitat in which to settle and metamorphose. For animals that are sessile or sedentary as adults, settlement onto substrates that are adequate for survival and reproduction is particularly critical, yet represents a challenge since patchily distributed settlement sites may be difficult to find along a coast or within an estuary. Recent studies have demonstrated that the underwater soundscape, the distinct sounds that emanate from habitats and contain information about their biological and physical characteristics, may serve as broad-scale environmental cue for marine larvae to find satisfactory settlement sites. Here, we contrast the acoustic characteristics of oyster reef and off-reef soft bottoms, and investigate the effect of habitat-associated estuarine sound on the settlement patterns of an economically and ecologically important reef-building bivalve, the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). Subtidal oyster reefs in coastal North Carolina, USA show distinct acoustic signatures compared to adjacent off-reef soft bottom habitats, characterized by consistently higher levels of sound in the 1.5–20 kHz range. Manipulative laboratory playback experiments found increased settlement in larval oyster cultures exposed to oyster reef sound compared to unstructured soft bottom sound or no sound treatments. In field experiments, ambient reef sound produced higher levels of oyster settlement in larval cultures than did off-reef sound treatments. The results suggest that oyster larvae have the ability to respond to sounds indicative of optimal settlement sites, and this is the first evidence that habitat-related differences in estuarine sounds influence the settlement of a mollusk. Habitat-specific sound characteristics may represent an important settlement and habitat selection cue for estuarine invertebrates and could play a role in driving settlement and recruitment patterns in marine communities.},

Seahorses and pipefishes (family Syngnathidae) are extraordinary among fishes in their remarkable adaptations for paternal care and frequent occurrences of sex-role reversals (i.e., female-female competition for mates), offering exceptional opportunities to test predictions of sexual selection theory. During mating, the female transfers eggs into or onto specialized egg-brooding structures that are located on either the male's abdomen or its tail, where they are osmoregulated, aerated, and nourished by specially adapted structures. All syngnathid males exhibit this form of parental care but the brooding structures vary, ranging from the simple ventral gluing areas of some pipefishes to the completely enclosed pouches found in seahorses. We present a molecular phylogeny that indicates that the diversification of pouch types is positively correlated with the major e...},

We present general yet detailed guidance for the development of comprehensive, concise, and effective data management for monitoring projects. The guidance is presented as a graded approach, matching the scale of data management to the needs of the organization and the complexity of the project. We address the following topics: roles and responsibilities; consistent and precise data collection; calibration of field crews and instrumentation; management of tabular, photographic, video, and sound data; data completeness and quality; development of metadata; archiving data; and evaluation of existing data from other sources. This guidance will help practitioners execute effective data management, thereby, improving the quality and usability of data for meeting project objectives as well as broader meta-analysis and macrosystem ecology research.},

abstract = {Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme events. However, the biological consequences of extremes remain poorly resolved owing to their unpredictable nature and difficulty in quantifying their mechanisms and impacts. One key feature delivering pre-cipitation extremes is an atmospheric river (AR), a long and narrow filament of enhanced water vapour transport. Despite recent attention, the biological impacts of ARs remain undocumented. Here, we use biological data coupled with remotely sensed and in situ environmental data to describe the role of ARs in the near 100{\%} mass mortality of wild oysters in northern San Francisco Bay. In March 2011, a series of ARs made landfall within California, contributing an estimated 69.3{\%} of the precipitation within the watershed and driving an extreme freshwater discharge into San Francisco Bay. This discharge caused sustained low salinities (less than 6.3) that almost perfectly matched the known oyster critical salinity tolerance and was coincident with a mass mortality of one of the most abundant popu-lations throughout this species' range. This is a concern, because wild oysters remain a fraction of their historical abundance and have yet to recover. This study highlights a novel mechanism by which precipitation extremes may affect natural systems and the persistence of sensitive species in the face of environmental change.},
