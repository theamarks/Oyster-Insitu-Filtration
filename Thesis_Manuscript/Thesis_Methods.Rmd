# Methods

## Study Sites
I conducted my research from February 2018 to June 2019 at four sties along the California coast. The sites represent a range of constructed oyster habitats including shell reef, shell bed, and floating aquaculture lines.
The San Francisco Living Shorelines Project, San Francisco Bay, California was constructed July - August 2012 by The Coastal Conservancy and collaborators [@Latta2015]. 
It is a large-scale experiment that investigates the effects of various reef designs and *Z. marina* plantings on biological habitat and physical shoreline protection [@EnvironmentalScienceAssociates2014]. 
The project has two major sites, The Nature Conservancy site in San Rafael, CA and the Eden Landing Ecological Reserve in Hayward, CA. 
The Nature Conservancy site (37.964179, -122.487217, hensforth San Rafael) was selected for this study because of its accessability, size, and higher abundances of *O. lurida*. 
San Rafael consists of a matrix of shell bag reefs with a 32 m x 10 m footprint consisting of 3 rows of 8 shell bag reefs [@EnvironmentalScienceAssociates2014]. 
Each reef measures 2 m x 2 m x 1 m  and is composed of 4 shell bag elements measuring 1 m x 1 m x 1 m. A shell bag are made of plastic mesh filled with clean, commercially-grown *C. gigas* shell. 
The matrix is positioned approximately 200 m from shore on a mudflat at -0.3 m MLLW (Mean Low Lower Water) tidal evlevation [@EnvironmentalScienceAssociates2014]. 

The Upper Newport Bay Living Shorelines Project, Newport Bay, California was constructed May 2017 by Orange County Coast Keeper, and collaborators at CSU Fullerton and CSU Long Beach. 
This experimental project investigates the interactions between constructed shell beds and transplanted *Z. marina* on biological communities. 
The project consists of 4 sites, Pacfic Coast Highway, Westcliff, Deanza, and Shellmaker. This study only includes Deanza (33.620291, -117.897692, hensforth Newport Deanza) and Shellmaker (33.622097, -117.892399, hensforth Newport Shellmaker) because of their accessibility, water flow dynamics, and higher abundances of *O. lurida*. 
Each site has a 4 plots; a combination of control mudflats, *Z. marina* beds, and shell beds. The shell beds measure 20 m x 1 m x 0.25 m and are constructed with coconut coir bogs filled with clean commercially-grown *C. gigas* and mussel *species name* shell. 
The beds are positioned approximately 30 m from shore on a frim mudflat at approximately 0.15 m MLLW.

The Morro Bay Oyster Company (MBOC) is a commercial aquaculture operation in Morro Bay, Califonia (35.334707, -120.844000, hensforth Morro Bay). 
MBOC grows *C. gigas* in plastic mesh bags measuring about (insert dimensions) attached to floating lines that stretch across an area about 75 m x 75 m. 
The bags of oysters rest on the underlying mudflat at around 0 m MLLW, and float to the surface as the tide rises. 

## Exerpimental Setup
Methods were adapted from @Grizzle2006 and @Grizzle2008's in situ filtration measurements of bivalve beds on the Atlantic coast.
Two identical water quality sondes (Yellow Springs Instruments 6600EDS) measured the change in chlorophyll $\alpha$), temperature, salinity, and turbidity from positions upstream and downstream of the oyster habitat. 
The sondes hung inside of free standing PVC (polyvinyl chloride) housings with water flow slats (Figure \ref{fig:fieldgear}) and hung at hiehgt to align the sesnsors with the approximate height of the oyster habitat. 
Water tracing dye (Rhodamine WT) released upstream of the habitat provided a visual indicator of water flow direction and any cross currents or eddies.
The sonde housings were positioned to measure an uninterupted linear water flow across the oyster habitat based on the dye.
Linear water flow assumes that the upstream instrument is measureing the same water as the downstream instrument.
An electromagnetic meter (Marsh McBirney Flo Mate 2000) measured water velocity in the center of the habitat at the depth of the sensors during the begining, middle, and end of each trial. 
Slow water velocity (between 0.1 â€“ 0.3 m/s) and no wind conditions are ideal to reduce the resuspension of benthic sediments into the water column that can obfuscate the filtration signal [@Grizzle2008].
Depth measurements were recorded at each sonde housing at the begining and end of the filtration trial along with the distance between sondes.
The sondes recorded measurements every 1 second, and filtration trials lasted as long as field conditions were appropriate; anywhere from 5 and 30 minutes. 
Detailed notes of all field events and disturbances were recorded with a watch synced to the sondes' internal clocks.

## Chlorphyll $\alpha$ Corrections
In addition to the filtration trial, two side-by-side trials were conducted before and after the filtration tial to record and correct any chlorophyll $\alpha$ sensor differences.
In the side-by-side trials, I placed the instruments adjacent to compare the sensors' chlorophyll $\alpha$ measurements in the same mass of water for about 10 minuets.  
The time series data was reviewed for extreme Chl $\alpha$ spikes that would skew the average Chl $\alpha$.
Extreme Chl $\alpha$ values were removed from the time series along with the corresponding data from the other sonde.
The average Chl $\alpha$ difference between sondes in the side-by-side trail was divided in half to get a correction term for filtration trial Chl $\alpha$ measurements.
The sonde with higher Chl $\alpha$ in the side-by-side trial was corrected in the filtration trial by subtracting the correction term from Chl $\alpha$ measurements, and the lower reading sonde was corrected by adding the correction term.

### Seston Content
I determined seston Total Particulate Content (TPM), Particulate Inorganic Matter (PIM), Particulate Organic Matter (POM), and Organic content (OC) by collecting water samples adjacent to the study area. 
The water samples were filtered through Whatman GF/F pre-wash and weighed filters in the field, and filters were stored on ice until they could be stored in a freezer. 
Thawed filters were rinsed with a 0.5 M ammonium formate solution to remove salt. 
Typically this step follows immediately after filtering [@Gray2018], but this was not possible to do in the field. 
Filters were then dried in an 60&deg;C oven for 48 hours, and weighed to determine TPM (\ref{eq:TPM}). 
Next, the dried filters were ashed at 450&deg;C for \( \leq 4 \) hours and weighed to determine PIM (\ref{eq:PIM}) and POM (\ref{eq:POM}). Seston OC is simple the ratio of POM to TPM.
***Need to address my filter weight mistakes?***

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:TPM}
TPM (mg/L)= \frac{Filter Dry Weight (mg) - Filter Pre Weight (mg)}{Water sample volume (mL)} \times 1000
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:PIM}
PIM (mg/L)= TPM (mg/L) - \frac{Filter Ash Weight (mg) - Filter Pre Weight (mg)}{Water sample volume (ml)} \times 1000
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:POM}
POM (mg/L) = TPM (mg/L) - PIM (mg/L)
\end{equation}

### Filtration Calculations & Analysis
To calculate filtration I first paired upstream and downstream measurements. 
I used average water velocity and sonde distance to estimate the time it took a parcile of water to travel from the upstream sonde to the downstream sonde. 
The travel time was subtracted from downstream measurement timestamps to pair with upstream sonde measurements; unpaired measurements were discarded. 
Next, I calculated percent Chl $\alpha$ removal (\(\autoref{Eq:PrctChl}\)) and habitat clearance rate (\(\autoref{Eq:Lhrm2}\)). 
Percent chlorophyll $\alpha$ removed is simply the relative change in chlorophyll $\alpha$ concentration from upstream ($Chl_{up}$) to downstream ($Chl_{down}$). Habitat filtration, originally used by @Milbrandt2015a, expresses filtration as a rate and in terms of habitat area rather than the traditional dry tissue weight **(Need references)**. 
$A_{Xsec}$ is the cross-sectional area of the water column (water depth $\times$ assumed 1 m width), *V* is the average water velocity (m/hr), *1000* is the conversion factor from $m^2$ to L, $A_{habitat}$ is the area being measured (distance between the instruments $\times$ assumed 1 m width), $Chl_{up}$ is the upstream chlorophyll $\alpha$ concentration, and $Chl_{down}$ is the downstream chlorophyll $\alpha$ concentration.

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:PrctChl}
\% Chl\alpha Removal = \frac{Chl_{up} - Chl_{down}}{Chl_{up}} \times 100
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:Lhrm2}
HFR (Lhr^{-1}m^2) = \frac{A_{Xsec} \times V \times 1000}{A_{habitat}} \times \frac{Chl_{up} - Chl_{down}}{Chl_{up}}
\end{equation}

## Extra text

Higher organic content means a higher proportion of digestable food, which increases clearance rates (@Gray2017a). [read Bayne et al. 1989; BarillÃ© et al. 1997; Hawkins et al. 1998a; Bayne 2002; Ward and Shumway 2004)]. 

The San Diego site is a FLoating UPwelling SYstem (FLUPSY) aquaculture structure operated by the Port of San Diego Blue Economy Incubator Program. 
A FLUPSY is an upwelling system that pulls water up through baskets submerged at the water surface. 
The upwelling provides juvenile oysters with a continuous supply of food from the surrounding water. 
The San Diego site requires modified methods to measure filtration. The upstream sonde is hung off the FLUPSY at the depth of the basket bottom and the downstream sonde is placed at the basket outflow channel. 
The operation of this FLUPSY has been episodic during my study to date and it is uncertain if operation will continue.

Chlorophyll a - what it is biologically, why its important. Check @Secor2006 for ideas.

###Bivalve Density and Richness
We will also record positive and negative control measurements in San Diego Bay, and, as needed, at aquaculture operations in Agua Hedionda or Morro Bay. 
Filter feeder species richness, density, and shell height at each study site will also be measured by using replicate (n=10-15) haphazardly placed 0.25m2 quadrats and calipers.


These methods were originally designed for shellfish beds on the East Coast; two features of O. lurida require us to perform a positive control for the proposed methods. 
O. lurida have a lower filtration rate compared to larger species such as C. gigas and C. virginica (zu Ermgassen, Gray, et al. 2013, Gray & Langdon 2017), and grow in smaller, less dense beds then the reefs formed by Crassostrea species (Beck et al. 2009). 

### Experimental Design
This research is based on previous in situ filtration studies of Atlantic bivalve reefs by @Grizzle2006, @Grizzle2008, and @Milbrandt2015a. 
More precice methods of measuring bivalve filtration exsist, like the biodeposition method used in @Gray2017a and @Hawkins1996a. 
However, the in situ methods described in @Grizzle2006 measure an entire filter-feeding community within an oyster habitat with natural water quality and flow dynamics. 
@Grizzle2008â€™s results inform the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts' *C. virginica* habitat filtration models in ~~the National Oceans and Atmopsheric Administration's (NOAA) and The Nature Concervancy's~~ "A Manager's Guide: Setting Objectives for Oyster Habitat Restoration Using Ecosystem Services" and associated online tool at https://oceanwealth.org/tools/oyster-calculator/ [@ZuErmgassen2016]. 
This research aims to provide field filtraiton rates for the *O. lurida* habitat model using similar methods.
